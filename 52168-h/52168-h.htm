<p class="center">(Concluded.)</p>

<p>The Piano-Forte Action Regulator adjusts the action in all its
operations. Those parts are supplied and fitted that are still wanting
to complete it. The depth of the touch is regulated, the keys levelled,
the drop of the hammer adjusted, and all is now seemingly in order for
playing; but in Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray's Factory, the instrument
has to undergo another ordeal in the way of regulating; for, after
standing for several days or weeks, and being tuned and somewhat used,
it passes into the hands of another and last regulator, who again
examines minutely every part, readjusts the action, key by key, and
note by note, until all is as it were, perfect. And now its tone must
be regulated, and the "hammer finisher" takes it in charge, and gives
it the last finishing touch; every note from the bass to the treble
must give out a full, rich, even, melodious tone. This is a very
important branch of the business; for great care and much experience
are required to detect the various qualities and shades of tone, and
to know how to alter and adjust the hammer in such a way as to produce
the desired result. Some performers prefer a hard or brilliant tone;
others a full soft tone; and others, again, a full clear tone of medium
quality. It is the hammer-finisher's duty to see that each note in the
whole instrument shall correspond in quality and brilliancy with the
others. The piano-fortes of Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray are celebrated
for their full organ tone, and for the even quality of each note; for
the rich, full, and harmonious music, rather than the noise, which they
make; and a discriminating public have set their stamp of approbation
on their efforts, if we may judge by the great and increasing demand
for their instruments.</p>

<p>The instrument, after being tuned, is ready for the ware-room or
parlor.</p>

<p>But several operations we have purposely passed by, as it was our
wish to give a clear idea of the structure of the piano-forte by
exhibiting, from stage to stage, the progress of the manufacture of the
musical machinery. Let us now look after the construction of the other
parts of the instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The "leg-bodies," as they come from the machine, are cut out in
shape in a rough state, ready for being veneered (or covered with a
thin coating of rosewood or mahogany); and, as they are of various
curved and crooked forms, it is a trade by itself to bend the veneers
and apply them correctly. The veneers are curved and bent to the
shapes required while hot, or over hot irons, and then applied to the
leg-bodies by "calls," or blocks of wood cut out to exactly fit the
surface to be veneered. These calls are heated in the steam ovens. The
surface of the leg having been covered with glue, the veneer is put on,
and then the hot call is applied and screwed to it by large handscrews
holding the veneer closely and firmly to the surface to be covered. The
call, by warming the glue, causes it to adhere to the legs and veneer;
and, when cold and dry, holds the veneer firmly to its place, covering
the surface of the leg entire, and giving it the appearance of solid
rosewood, or of whatever wood is used for the purpose. Only one surface
can be veneered at a time, and then the screws must remain on until
it is cold or dry; and, as the legs have many distinct surfaces, they
must be handled many times, and, of course, much labor is expended on
them. After all the sides are veneered, they must be trimmed, scraped,
and finished, and all imperfections in the wood made perfect, ready for
being varnished.</p>

<p>The desks are made by being so framed together as to give strength,
then veneered, and, after being varnished and polished, are sawed out
in beautiful forms and shapes by scroll saws, in the machine-shop. They
have thus to pass through quite a number of processes before they are
ready to constitute a part of a finished piano-forte. The same can be
said of many other parts of the instrument that are made separate, and
applied when wanted in the instrument, such as lyres, leg-blocks, or
caps, &amp;c. And, as each workman is employed at but one branch alone,
and perfects his part, it is evident that, when put together correctly,
the whole will be perfect. And, as Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray conduct
their business, there are from twenty to twenty-four distinct kinds of
work or trades carried on in their establishment. Thus, the case-maker
makes cases; the leg-maker legs; the key-maker keys; the action-maker
action; the finisher duts the action into the piano; the regulator
adjusts it; and thus each workman bends the whole of his energies
and time to the one branch at which he is employed. The result of
this division of labor is strikingly shown in the perfection to which
Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray have brought the art of piano-forte
making, as may be seen in their superior and splendid instruments.</p>

<p>The putting together the different parts of the piano-forte, such
as the top, the legs, the desk, the lyre, &amp;c., to the case,
constitutes what is called fly-finishing. The top is finished by the
case-maker in one piece, and remains so until varnished and polished;
then the fly-finisher saws it apart, and applies the butts or hinges,
so that the front will open over the keys; puts on all the hinges;
hangs the front or "lock-board" to the top; and completes it. He also
takes the legs as they come from the leg-maker, and fits them to the
case by means of a screw cut on some hard wood, such as birch or
iron-wood, one end of which is securely fastened into the leg, and the
other end screws into the bottom of the piano. The fly-finisher also
puts on the castors, locks, and all the finishing minutiæ to complete
the external furniture of the instrument, when it is ready for the
ware-rooms, to which it is next lowered by means of a steam elevator,
sufficiently large to hold a piano-forte placed on its legs, together
with the workman in charge of it.</p>

<p>The following plate exhibits a piano-forte on the elevator passing
from the fly-finisher's department to the ware-rooms. Of these steam
elevators there are two, one at each end of the building; one for
passing workmen, as well as lumber, to and from the machine-shop and
drying-rooms, and one for passing cases and pianos up and down to the
different rooms. Much ingenuity is shown in their construction, being
so adjusted as to be sent up or down by a person on either floor, or
by one on the platform, who, going or stopping at will, thus saves an
immense amount of hard labor.</p>

<p>Water from the Albany water-works is carried throughout the building
on to each floor, with sinks, hose, and every convenience for the
workmen, so that they may have no occasion to leave the premises during
the working hours. One thing we must not forget to point out, and
that is the Top Veneering-Press, made on the plan of "Dicks's Patent
Anti-Friction Press" (shown in the following engraving on the upper
floor at left hand), and we believe the only press of the kind in the
world. It was made to order expressly for Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray,
and its strong arms and massive iron bed-plates denote that it is
designed for purposes where power is required. It is used in veneering
the tops for their piano-fortes, and it is warranted that two men at
the cranks, in a moment's time, can produce a pressure of one hundred
tons with perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
ease. It is so arranged that the veneers are laid for several tops
at one time. Tops made and veneers laid under such a pressure will
remain level and true and perfectly secure. Messrs. Boardman &amp;
Gray have used this press upwards of eighteen months, and find that
it works excellently, and consider it a great addition to their other
labor-saving machines.</p>

<p>Having thus given a passing glance at most of the mechanical parts
of the piano-forte, we will now examine the varnishing and polishing
departments, consisting of some five or more large rooms. As the
different layers of varnish require time to dry, it is policy to let
the varnish harden while the workmen are busy putting in the various
internal parts of the piano. Thus the case, when it comes from the
case-maker, goes first to the first varnishing-room, and receives
several coats of varnish; and, when the workman is ready to put in the
sounding-board and iron frame, it is taken from the varnish-room to his
department; and, when he has finished his work, it is again returned
to the varnishing department, where it remains until the finisher wants
it, who, when done with it, returns it to the varnishing-room. Thus,
these varnishing-rooms are the store-rooms for not only the cases, but
all the parts that are varnished; and the drying of the varnishing
is going on all the time that the other work is progressing. In this
establishment, from 150 to 200 pianos are being manufactured in the
course of each day. In the varnish-rooms, from 100 to 150 cases are at
all times to be seen; others are in the hands of the workmen in the
different rooms, in the various stages of progress towards completion.
Besides the cases in the varnish-rooms, we may see all the different
parts of the pianos in dozens and hundreds, legs, lyres, tops, desks,
bars, &amp;c. &amp;c., forming quite a museum in its way. The processes
of varnishing and polishing are as follows: The cases, which are all
of rosewood, are covered first with a spirit-varnish made with shellac
gum, which, drying almost instantly, becomes hard, and keeps the gum
or pitch of the rosewood from acting on the regular oil varnish. After
the case has been "shellacked," it then receives its first "coat of
varnish" and left to dry; and then a second coat is applied, and again
it is left to dry. The varnish used is made of the hardest kind of
copal gum, and prepared for this express purpose. It is called scraping
varnish; it dries hard and brittle, and is intended to fill in the
grain of the wood. When it becomes thoroughly dry and hard, these two
coats are scraped off with a steel scraper. The case then receives
several coats of another kind of varnish; when this is dried, it is
ready for rubbing, which is effected by means of an article made of
cloth fastened on blocks of wood or cork; and the varnish is rubbed on
with ground pumice stone and water (a process somewhat similar to that
of polishing marble). A large machine, driven by the engine, is used
for rubbing the tops of pianos and other large surfaces. When the whole
surface is perfectly smooth and even, it receives an additional coat
of varnish. Each coat having become dry, hard, and firm, the surface
receives another rubbing until it is perfectly smooth,
when it receives a last flowing coat. After it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thoroughly dried and hardened, it is ready for
the polishing process, which consists in first rubbing
the surface with fine rotten stone, and then
polishing with the fingers and hands until the
whole surface is like a mirror wherein we can</p>

</div>

<p>In the preceding statement, we have simply
given an outline of the mechanical branches of
the business, and a general description of the
lumber required, and its peculiar seasoning and
preparation prior to use. Large quantities of
rosewood are used for veneering and carved
work, slipping, &amp;c. Just now, this is the fashionable
wood for furniture; nothing else is used
in the external finish of the piano-fortes of
Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray. A view of their
large veneer-room would excite the astonishment
of the novice. Rosewood is brought from
South America, and is at present a very important
article of commerce, a large number of
ships being engaged in this trade alone, to say
nothing of the thousands employed in getting it
from its native forests for shipping, and the
thousands more busy in preparing it for the
market after it has reached this country. Much
that is used by Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray is
sawed into veneers, and prepared expressly for
them at the mills at Cohoes, N. Y. They buy
large quantities at a time, and, of course, have a
large supply on hand ready for immediate use.
They always select the most richly-figured wood
in the market, believing that rich music should
always proceed from a beautiful instrument.
Thick rosewood is constantly undergoing seasoning
for those portions which require solid
wood. And one thing, dear reader, we would
say; and that is, where rosewood veneers are
put on hard wood well seasoned, and prepared
correctly, they are much more durable than the
solid rosewood would be, not being so liable to
check and warp. They also make use of a large
quantity of hardware in the form of "tuning
pins"&mdash;upwards of a ton per year. Of iron
plates they use some twenty-five tons. Their
outlay for steel music wire amounts to hundreds
of dollars per year; not to speak of the locks,
pedal feet, butts and hinges, plated covering
wire for the bass strings, bridge pins, centre
pins, steel springs, and screws of various kinds
and sizes, of which they use many thousand gross
annually. Of all these, they must keep a supply
constantly on hand, as it will not do for
their work to stop for want of materials. A
large capital is at command at all times; and,
as many of these things require to be made expressly
to order, calculation, judgment, and close
attention are needed to keep all moving smoothly
on.</p>

<p>Cloth is used for a variety of purposes in the
establishment of Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray. It
is made and prepared expressly for their use,
from fine wool, of various thicknesses and colors,
according to the use for which it is designed.
Whether its texture be heavy or thick,
firm or loose, smooth or even, soft or hard,
every kind has its peculiar place and use. Here
we would give a word of caution to the reader.
So much cloth is used in and about the action
of the piano-forte, that we must beware of the
insidious moth, which will often penetrate and
live in its soft folds, thereby doing much damage
to the instrument. A little spirits of
turpentine, or camphor, is a good protection
against them.</p>

<p>Ivory is another article which is largely used.
Being expensive, no little capital is employed in
keeping an adequate supply at all times on
hand.</p>

<p>And then there is buckskin of various kinds
and degrees of finish, sand-paper, glue, and a
variety of other things, all of which are extensively
employed in the business.</p>

<p>So far, we have treated merely of materials
and labor. We have said nothing of the science
of piano-forte making. If, after all the pains
taken in selecting and preparing the materials
required, the scale of the instrument shall not
be correctly laid down on scientific principles;
that is to say, if the whole is not constructed in
a scientific manner, we shall not have a perfect
musical instrument. So the starting-point in
making a piano-forte is in having a scale by
which to work. This scale must be of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
improved pattern, and laid out with the utmost
nicety, and with mathematical precision. By
the scale, we mean the length of each string,
and the shape of the bridges over which it passes.
The length of the string for each note, and its
size, are calculated by mathematical rules, and
perfected by numerous experiments; and by
these experiments alone can perfection be attained
in the manufacture of the instrument.
Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray use new and improved
circular scales of their own construction,
in which they have embodied all the improvements
which have from time to time been discovered.
They are determined that nothing
shall surpass, if anything equals, their <span class="smcap">Dolce
Campana Attachment</span>.</p>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_105big.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>The great improvement of this age in the
manufacture of the piano-forte is the Dolce
Campana Attachment, invented by Mr. Jas. A.
Gray, of the firm of Boardman &amp; Gray, and
patented in 1848 not only in this country, but
in England and her colonies. It consists of
a series of weights held in a frame over the
bridge of the piano-forte, which is attached to
the sounding-board; for the crooked bridge of
the piano, at the left hand, is fast to and part of
the sounding-board. The strings passing over,
and firmly held to this bridge, impart vibration
to the sounding-board, and thus tone to the
piano. These weights, resting in a frame, are
connected with a pedal, so that when the pedal
is pressed down, they are let down by their own
weight, and rest on screws or pins inserted in
the bridge, the tops of which are above the pins
that hold the strings, and thus control the vibrations
of the bridge and sounding-board. By this
arrangement, almost any sound in the music
scale can be obtained, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad libitum</i>, at the option
of the pianist; and as it is so very simple, and
in no way liable to get out of order, or to disturb
the action of the piano, of course it must be
valuable. But let us listen for ourselves. We
try one of the full rich-toned pianos we have
described, and, pressing down the pedal, the
tone is softened down to a delicious, clear, and
delicate sweetness, which is indescribably charming,
"like the music of distant clear-toned bells
chiming forth their music through wood and
dell." We strike full chords with the pedal
down, and, holding the key, let the pedal up
slowly, and the music swells forth in rich tones
which are perfectly surprising. Thus hundreds
of beautiful effects are elicited at the will of the
performer. This Dolce Campana Attachment
is the great desideratum which has been required
to perfect the piano-forte, and by using it in
combination with the other pedals of the instrument,
the lightest shades of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">altissimo</i>, alternating
with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">crescendo</i> notes, may be produced with
comparative ease. Its peculiar qualities are the
clearness, the brilliancy, and the delicacy of its
touch. Those who, in the profession, have
tested this improvement have, almost without
an exception, given it their unqualified approbation;
and amateurs, committees of examination,
editors, clergymen, and thousands of others also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
speak of it in terms of the highest praise. Together
with the piano-forte of Messrs. Boardman
&amp; Gray, it has received ten first class premiums
by various fairs and institutes. And we predict
that but a few years will pass ere no piano-forte
will be considered perfect without this famous
attachment.</p>

<p>We must now examine its structure and
finish. The attachment consists of a series of
weights of lead cased in brass, and held in their
places by brass arms, which are fastened in a
frame. This frame is secured, at its ends, to
brass uprights screwed into the iron frame of the
piano; and the attachment frame works in these
uprights on pivots, so that the weights can be
moved up or down from the bridge. The frame
rests on a rod which passes through the piano,
and connected with the pedal; and the weights
are kept raised off the pins or screws in the
bridge by means of a large steel spring acting on
a long lever under the bottom of the piano,
against which the pedal acts; so that the pressing
down of the pedal lets the attachment down
on to its rests on the bridge, and thus controls
the vibrations of the sounding-board and strings.
The weights and arms are finished in brass or
silver. The frame in which they rest is either
bronzed or finished in goldleaf, and thus the
whole forms a most beautiful addition to the interior
finish of the piano-forte.</p>

<p>Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray have applied upwards
of a thousand of these attachments to
piano-fortes, many of which have been in use
four and five years, and they have never found
that the attachment injured the piano in any
way. As their piano-fortes without the attachment
have no superiors for perfection in their
manufacture, for the fulness and sweetness of
their tone, for the delicacy of their touch and
action, it may easily be seen how, with this attachment,
they must distance all competition.</p>

<p>And now, dear reader, we have attempted to
show you how good piano-fortes are made; to
give you an idea of the varied materials which
are requisite for this purpose; and to describe the
numerous processes to which they are subjected,
before a really perfect instrument can be produced.</p>

<p>The manufacturing department is under the
immediate supervision of Mr. James A. Gray,
one of the firm, who gives his time personally
to the business. He selects and purchases all
the materials used in the establishment. He is
thoroughly master of his vocation, having made
it a study for life. No piano-forte is permitted
to leave the concern until it has been submitted
to his careful inspection. If, on examination,
an instrument proves to be imperfect, it is re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>turned
to the workman to remedy the defect.
He is constantly introducing improvements, and
producing new patterns and designs, to keep up,
in all things, with the progress of the age.</p>

<p>The senior partner of the firm, Mr. Wm. G.
Boardman, attends to the sales, and gives his
attention to the financial department of the
business. Thus, the proprietors reap the benefit
of a division of labor in their work, and each is
enabled to devote his entire time and energies to
his own duties. Their great success is a proof
of their industry and honorable devotion to their
calling. They are gentlemen in every sense of
the word, esteemed by all who know them, and
honored and trusted by all who have business
connections with them. They liberally compensate
the workmen in their employ, and act
on the principle that the "laborer is worthy of
his hire." Their workmen never wait for the
return due their labor. Their compensation is
always ready, with open hand. The business
of the proprietors has increased very rapidly for
the last few years, and, although they are constantly
enlarging and improving their works,
they find themselves unable to satisfy the increasing
demand for their piano-fortes. Their
establishment is situated at the corner of State
and Pearl Streets, Albany, N. Y., well known
as the "<cite>Old Elm-Tree Corner</cite>."</p>

<p>Their store is always open to the public, and
constantly thronged with customers and visitors,
who meet with attention and courtesy from the
proprietors and persons in attendance. We
would advise our readers, should business or
pleasure lead them to the capital of the Empire
State, to call on Messrs. Boardman &amp; Gray at
their ware-rooms, even though they should not
wish to purchase anything from them; for they
may spend an hour very pleasantly in examining
and listening to their beautiful and fine-toned
piano-fortes with the Dolce Campana
Attachment.</p>


<p class="p5b">INSTRUCTIONS.</p>

<p>Have your piano-forte tuned, at least four times
in the year, by an experienced tuner; if you
neglect it too long without tuning, it usually
becomes flat, and troubles a tuner to get it to
stay at concert pitch, especially in the country.
Never place the instrument against an outside
wall, or in a cold, damp room. Close the instrument
immediately after your practice; by
leaving it open, dust fixes on the sound-board
and corrodes the movements, and, if in a damp
room, the strings soon rust.</p>

<p>Should the piano-forte stand near or opposite
a window, guard, if possible, against its being
opened, especially on a wet or damp day; and,
when the sun is on the window, draw the blind
down. Avoid putting metallic or other articles
on or in the piano-forte; such things frequently
cause unpleasant vibrations, and sometimes injure
the instrument. The more equal the temperature
of the room, the better the piano will
stand in tune.</p>

<h3><a name="DEVELOPMENT_OF_THE_LUNGS" id="DEVELOPMENT_OF_THE_LUNGS"></a>DEVELOPMENT OF THE LUNGS.</h3>

<p>Much has been said and written upon diet,
eating and drinking, but I do not recollect ever
noticing a remark in any writer upon breathing,
or the manner of breathing. Multitudes, and
especially ladies in easy circumstances, contract
a vicious and destructive mode of breathing.
They suppress their breathing and contract the
habit of short, quick breathing, not carrying the
breath half way down the chest, and scarcely
expanding the lower portions of the chest at all.
Lacing the bottom of the chest also greatly increases
this evil, and confirms a bad habit of
breathing. Children that move about a great deal
in the open air, and in no way laced, breathe
deep and full in the bottom of the chest, and
every part of it. So also with most out-door
laborers, and persons who take a great deal of
exercise in the open air, because the lungs give
us the power of action, and the more exercise we
take, especially out of doors, the larger the lungs
become, and the less liable to disease. In all
occupations that require standing, keep the person
straight. If at table, let it be high, raised
up nearly to the armpits, so as not to require
you to stoop; you will find the employment
much easier&mdash;not one half so fatiguing, whilst
the form of the chest and symmetry of the figure
will remain perfect. You have noticed that
a vast many tall ladies stoop, whilst a great many
short ones are straight. This arises, I think,
from the table at which they sit or work, or occupy
themselves, or study, being of a medium
height&mdash;for a short one. This should be carefully
corrected and regarded, so that each lady may
occupy herself at the table to suit her, and thus
prevent the possibility or the necessity of stooping.
It will be as well not to remain too long
in a sitting position, but to rise occasionally, and
thus relieve the body from its bending position.
The arms could be moved about from time to
time.</p>

<h2><a name="VIRGINIA_PERCY_A_SKETCH_OF_SOUTHERN_LIFE" id="VIRGINIA_PERCY_A_SKETCH_OF_SOUTHERN_LIFE"></a>VIRGINIA PERCY.&mdash;A SKETCH OF SOUTHERN LIFE.</h2>

<p class="p8">BY PAULINE FORSYTH.</p>


<p>One evening, at a large party, my attention
was attracted by a tall, distinguished-looking
young gentleman, whom I had never seen before.
Though a stranger to me, he was evidently
well known by most in the room, for he was
speaking familiarly to several who stood near
him, and bowing occasionally to others as they
passed; yet all the time he was thus occupied,
his eyes constantly sought the quiet corner to
which, according to my usual habit, I had retreated.
Strangers being rare in Louden, and
gentlemen of his appearance remarkable in any
place, I was at first disposed to gratify a natural
curiosity with regard to him, but my eyes, sent
out on their exploring expedition, met his so
often, that at last, in a state of great confusion,
I fastened them on the floor and resolved I
would not raise them again for ten minutes.
Meantime, I asked Virginia Percy, who was
sitting by me, "Who that strange gentleman by
the piano was? He looks like an officer," I
continued.</p>

<p>"He is," she replied; "he is Lieutenant Marshall,
a son of that Mr. Marshall who lives on
the next plantation to us."</p>

<p>"Don't you know him?" asked I, surprised
that, while greeting all his friends, he had not
yet approached her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," said she, quickly; "I
have known him all my life."</p>

<p>Virginia, like most Southern girls, was a
thorough-bred aristocrat, and I ascribed her evident
want of appreciation of Lieutenant Marshall,
and of interest in him, to the fact that his
father's family, while respectable, did not belong
to the "upper ten"&mdash;to use the only phrase
that describes appropriately the class to which
it refers&mdash;for they are distinguished neither by
goodness, wit, nor birth, but they have become,
by some concatenation of circumstances in this
ever-shifting kaleidoscope of society, the upper
stratum, and the position, once obtained, though
it sometimes requires a severe struggle to gain
it, is easy enough to keep.</p>

<p>"He is the most strikingly handsome man I
ever saw," said I.</p>

<p>Virginia made no answer. Piqued at her indifference,
and resolved to show my freedom
from all narrow and illiberal prejudices with
regard to society or position, I went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He has what handsome men so often want.
They have generally something feminine about
them; but he is essentially manly and dignified.
I think that his expression would be perhaps a
little too stern; only, when he speaks or even
listens, his smile has so much warmth and kindness
in it."</p>

<p>"You have seen a great deal in a little while,"
said Virginia.</p>

<p>"Yes, and under great difficulties too." Here
I was interrupted by the approach of the person
of whom we were speaking, accompanied by the
lady of the house. He was introduced to me,
and acknowledging Virginia's presence by a low
bow, he seated himself by me and commenced a
conversation. Much as I had admired him at a
distance, this was an attention with which I
would willingly have dispensed, for, naturally
very shy, to attempt to entertain a stranger was
distressing to me. Therefore, though I wondered
a little that Virginia still retained her seat near
me, so that she was obliged occasionally to join
in the conversation with one whom she seemed
to consider beneath her, yet I was pleased by
her doing so, and attributed it to her friendship
for me, and her consideration for my peculiarities.</p>

<p>During all the evening, Lieutenant Marshall
paid me marked attention, so much so that, by
the time we were ready to go home, I had become
the target for all the jokes and witticisms
that are kept laid up for such occasions. In a
little place like Louden, where everybody knew
everybody, and there was but little going on to
talk about, any circumstance that would afford
scope for harmless gossip and teasing was "nuts"
to the good people, and before noon the next
day it was generally understood, throughout
Louden and its vicinity, that "Lieutenant Marshall
was desperately smitten with Miss Forsyth."</p>

<p>My own vanity being thus supported by the
openly expressed opinions of the discerning
public, it is hardly to be wondered at if for a
while I shared their delusion and their belief.
But, being even then a little given to metaphysics
and analytic investigations of all mental
phenomena that fell under my notice, instead of
putting the pretty rosebud that Mr. Marshall
offered me next my heart, I set myself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pulling it to pieces, and presently discovered
that it was not a real rose at all, only a patchwork,
scentless imitation.</p>

<p>In other words, I had ideas of my own on the
subject of love. As the six-year-old New Yorker
said, when he was asked if he had no one little
girl whom he loved better than any one else in
the world, "show me the boy of my age in
New York that hasn't!" so I can say, show
me the girl of seventeen who does not think
herself an adept in all the signs and tokens of
true love. And I soon settled it in my own
mind, that, when brought to the test of severe
and impartial criticism, Mr. Marshall did not
exhibit one evidence of real love, beyond an apparent
preference for my society. That the
preference was apparent and not real his abstraction
and indifference convinced me. At
first, considering it a duty I owed to society to
talk to those with whom I was thrown, unless
they would kindly relieve me of this obligation,
I tasked myself to weariness to find some topic
of mutual interest between my constant attendant
and myself. My remarks were all politely listened
and replied to, and then he fell back into
his state of reverie and silence. If there had
not been a shade of melancholy about him, I
should hardly have felt so patiently towards him
for engrossing so much of my time, while his
thoughts were evidently far away. But I had
settled it in my own mind that he had been in
love, and that the lady of his love had died&mdash;this
accounted for his sadness and abstraction; and
that some resemblance between the lost lady and
myself attracted him to me.</p>

<p>This little romance gave him quite an interest
to me, which was somewhat lessened by the discovery
that he shared in the village love of gossip.
I found that the only subjects that could
interest him at all were the petty daily events
that occurred to Virginia and myself, for we
were constantly together. About these he was
never weary of hearing, and would ask me the
minutest questions, and by his pleased attention
beguile me into long talks about such mere
trifles that I used to blush to recall them, and
then, as soon as I entered on some topic of higher
or more general interest, it needed but little discernment
to discover that courtesy alone prompted
the attention he gave me.</p>

<p>At last I began to grow quite weary of attentions
which I could not persuade myself were
prompted by anything but recollections of the
dead, and spoke of Lieutenant Marshall to Virginia,
my only confidant, constantly, as "that
tiresome man." Perhaps it was owing to her
desire to relieve me of one of my heaviest burdens
that she so often made one in our <em>tête-à-têtes</em>,
and by infusing a great deal more spirit
and life in our conversation, assisted me greatly.
I do not know how it happened, but we both
brightened wonderfully when Virginia joined
us, and although I might have been half asleep
with intense dulness a few moments before, I
generally found myself very soon wide awake,
and with auditors so attentive and easily pleased
that I began to be quite uplifted with elevated
ideas of my own newly developed conversational
powers. One evening, there was a little gathering
of young people in a house where the hostess
did not approve of dancing. We were all seated
in a stiff circle round the room doing our best to
amuse and be amused by rational conversation.
The appearance of things was very unpromising,
and the lady of the house seemed quite uneasy;
at last she proposed a promenade, and anything
to break up the monotony was eagerly caught at.
The ladies and gentlemen, like prisoners marching
for exercise, were soon walking in at one
door and out at another with great precision and
order. I expected Mr. Marshall to ask me to
join the staid procession, but perhaps marching
seemed too much like work to him, for he proposed
instead a game of backgammon. This
had always appeared to me an uninteresting,
rattling, flighty sort of a game; but to amuse so
sorrow-stricken a man I would even have played
checkers.</p>

<p>Before we had finished the first game, I felt a
hand lightly resting on my shoulder, and looking
round, saw Virginia seated close behind me.
This was very kind in her, and I felt it to the
depths of my heart. She was a great favorite in
Louden, and to leave all who would have exerted
themselves to please and amuse her, to sit
quietly with me in a dull corner looking over a
game of backgammon, was an effort of friendship
of which I hardly thought that, in similar circumstances,
I should have been capable. When
the game was ended, I made a movement to close
the board, but Mr. Marshall asked me so earnestly
for one more, just one more, that I consented.
However, I took an opportunity, while
he was stooping to pick up some of the men that
had dropped, to whisper. "You need not stay here,
Virginia. You'll be dreadfully tired, and I
don't mind much being left alone; there's
Charles Foster looking quite distressed because
you won't walk with him."</p>

<p>"No, dear," said Virginia, very affectionately,
"there is not a person in the room I like half so
well to stay with as you."</p>

<p>A stranger, far away from home, these words
of affection from one whom I had loved from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the first, touched me powerfully, and almost involuntarily
I pressed my lips to her cheek as it
was bent towards me. Fortunately this little
<em>effusion</em> passed unobserved, and Mr. Marshall
and I resumed our game. But I turned several
times to look at Virginia, attracted by a beauty
in her that I had never noticed before. Her
features were regular and her countenance pleasing,
but her complexion was so colorless, and
her expression so composed and unvarying, that
I had never heard her called even pretty; but
that night she looked positively beautiful. Her
lips were crimson, her cheeks delicately flushed,
and there was a glow and light over her whole
face, and a glittering sparkle in her eye, as
though some internal flame was informing her
whole being with warmth and brightness. I
did not wonder that Mr. Marshall was so struck
by the change that his eyes rested often and admiringly
upon her, so that he hardly seemed to
know what he was doing.</p>

<p>"Virginia! Pauline! do come here," said a
laughing girl, looking in from the piazza to
which the whole party but our little group had
retreated. I started up to obey the summons,
for the sounds of merriment and laughter, mingled
with the notes of a favorite negro melody,
drew me with an irresistible attraction. Mr.
Marshall and Virginia did not move.</p>

<p>"Finish my game for me, will you?" said I to
Virginia; "I will return in a moment." But
my moment lengthened into nearly half an hour,
for four gentlemen of the party who were noted
for their musical skill had been persuaded to
send for their instruments and sing and play for
us. This they did so well that it was with reluctance
that at last I fulfilled my promise of
returning.</p>

<p>Virginia was playing with the backgammon
men as I entered, and Lieutenant Marshall was
talking to her in a low tone.</p>

<p>"There he is, just as tiresome as ever," thought
I; but we do not live in the palace of Youth
now, so that I said, as I approached them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, which has been victorious?"</p>

<p>Virginia looked as though she had never heard
of a game of backgammon, and it was a minute
or two before I was answered. At last Mr.
Marshall said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;that is, I mean Miss Virginia was"&mdash;and
he did not seem exactly to know what he
did mean.</p>

<p>"Do come out on the porch," said I, benevolently
intending to relieve Virginia from a great
bore; "we are having some delightful singing,
and it is a very pleasant night." And I succeeded
in inducing them both to accompany me.</p>

<p>That same evening, Virginia proposed to me
to fulfil a promise we had made some time before
of visiting her cousins Nannie and Bettie
Buckley. I was very willing to do so, having
conceived a great admiration for these ladies,
which I am afraid had no better foundation than
that they were very tall, and dressed more
showily and expensively than any one that I had
ever seen. Every summer they went to the
North, where they enjoyed the reputation of
being great heiresses, and consequently received
much attention. Their father's wealth, though
by no means so large as was supposed, was still
ample enough to allow them to keep up their
character as heiresses by a free expenditure at
the principal shops in New York and Philadelphia,
and they returned home with more magnificent
brocades, flashy-looking cashmeres and
bareges, and fantastic ball-dresses than would
have sufficed for ten years at Louden. I do not
think that my friends there appreciated them
any the more highly on account of these brilliant
robes, but I was still in that state of inexperience
when "fine feathers make fine birds," and I was
very much inclined to respond cordially to their
warmly proffered offers of intimacy, and wondered
that Virginia showed so little desire to
seek the society of such relations. I was so
pleased to find that she was at last willing to
accompany me there, that I at once consented
to go the next afternoon, spend Saturday and
Sunday with the Misses Buckley, and return
early on Monday morning.</p>

<p>We were to go on horseback, and when the
time arrived, I found that Virginia's brother
and younger sister were to accompany us. We
galloped on in that glow of spirits and enjoyment
that riding on horseback so often imparts;
when, as we passed Mr. Marshall's plantation,
the Lieutenant, as though he had been expecting
and waiting for us, opened the gate and joined
us.</p>

<p>"That man is becoming a perfect <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bête noir</i>
to me," said I to Ellen Percy; "I can never go
anywhere without him, lately."</p>

<p>I had hardly finished my speech, before it
struck me that there was something a little peculiar
in the greeting between Virginia and Lieutenant
Marshall, and a half-formed, undefined
suspicion rose in my mind. I banished it immediately,
however, for I looked upon Virginia as
the soul of truth, and if there had been anything
between herself and the man who had
been so openly attentive to me, I felt sure she
would have told me. Therefore, much against
my will, I allowed Ellen and George to ride on,
whilst I checked my horse, as fond of a race as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
its rider, to the slow pace that seemed to suit
my other two companions. It was not long,
however, before I intercepted one or two glances
that "spoke volumes"&mdash;ten folios could not
have revealed more to me&mdash;and all at once I
was seized with the oppressive consciousness of
being <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de trop</i>. My next thought was how I
should contrive to join Ellen, whose swift horse
had carried her far in advance of us. I could
think of no excuse that did not seem to me so
transparent as to be more than useless. At last,
murmuring some unintelligible words, I fairly ran
off. Afterwards apologizing to Virginia for my
abrupt mode of leaving her, saying that I had
tried in vain to manage it more skilfully, she
replied with some surprise&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear, I thought you managed it beautifully,
and so I have no doubt Lieutenant Marshall
did."</p>

<p>"If he thought at all about it," answered I;
and she smiled.</p>

<p>"Has it ever struck you&mdash;have you ever heard
anything about Lieutenant Marshall's being in
love with Virginia?" I asked, when I had overtaken
Ellen.</p>

<p>"A long time ago I heard it talked about a
little, but nothing has been said about it for the
last year or two. I have always thought, though,
that Virginia cared more about him than any
one else."</p>

<p>"It is strange she never has alluded to him to
me," said I; and I was inexpressibly pained at
this want of confidence on her part, revealed at
a time when I thought every feeling of her
heart was laid bare to me. Nor could I reconcile
the clandestine way in which they had
carried on their love-affair, with the previous
high opinion I had formed both of Virginia
and Mr. Marshall, as persons of the highest
integrity and principle. An indistinct feeling of
annoyance at having been used as a blind, and of
disappointment at the tarnish which had suddenly
obscured, in my eyes, the bright purity of Virginia's
character, prevented me for a time from
enjoying my ride. But deeper griefs than mine
would not long have been proof against the exhilaration
produced by rapid motion, through
southern woods, on a cool and balmy afternoon
in early spring.</p>

<p>Nature has no secrets in that genial clime.
She does not elaborate her delicate buds and
leaflets within the closely enveloping bark until
they burst suddenly upon you, full-formed and
perfect, but her workshop is the open air, and one
might almost fancy he could see her dainty fingers
patiently adding, day by day, one touch after
another, until her work is complete. I have
watched the slow development of an oak, from
the first red tassel to its full leaved glory, till I
have felt quite sure that if, by any of those
marvellous metamorphoses we read of in the
old mythology, I should ever feel myself taking
root and shape like it, I should know exactly
what would be expected of me. And so, my eye
caught and charmed by one beauty after another,
of flower, or tree, or cloud, I had regained all
my cheerfulness by the time we halted at the
plantation, to allow the lovers to overtake us.</p>

<p>They had loitered so far behind, that we had
to wait at least half an hour before they joined
us, but we were forbearing, and said nothing to
remind them of their want of consideration,
though I am afraid my silence was as much
owing to wounded feeling as anything else.</p>

<p>We were most cordially welcomed by Nancie
and Bettie Buckley, but I was so surprised at
the house and its furniture, that I hardly noticed
our reception. Was it possible, thought I, that
those gorgeously apparelled women came out of
those low, poorly furnished rooms, with their
stiff, old-fashioned chairs, and no carpets, no
sofas&mdash;no silver forks at tea&mdash;in short, few of
those little luxuries that long use makes almost
necessaries. Virginia explained the incongruity
to me by saying that cousin Tom, as she
called old Mr. Buckley, refused to allow the
least change to be made in their household arrangements.
His daughters might travel and
spend as much money as they pleased, but not
one of their new-fangled notions were allowed
to be introduced into the family. To make up
for every other deficiency, there was a most bewildering
number of servants of all ages and
sizes. They ran about the house like tame kittens.
Two accompanied me to my room at night,
and three assisted, to my great embarrassment,
at my morning toilet.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckley was a stout, uneducated, kind-hearted
sort of a man, with a high appreciation
of a mint-julep and a good cigar, and an intense
dislike of Yankees. This was so much a part
of his nature that he could not help expressing
it even to me, and it was so genuine, that, notwithstanding
my natural pride in my birthright,
I caught myself insensibly sympathizing. Towards
me personally, as a woman and a stranger,
he evidently felt nothing but a sort of tender pity
and concern. This he showed in the only way
he could think of, by mixing me a very strong
mint-julep, and urging me to drink it. I tried
to please him&mdash;in fact, I had watched the process
of making it, and thought I should like it; but
the very first attempt I made, gave me such a fit
of coughing, and came so near strangling me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that I gave up; after that, we all sat down on
the porch together until tea was ready, while
Mr. Buckley smoked his cigar and looked hopelessly
at me.</p>

<p>After tea, we returned to the porch and our
conversation, and Mr. Buckley to his cigar. In
the course of the evening, I missed Virginia and
my recreant knight, and they did not appear
until we were about separating for the night.
Virginia and I were to occupy the same room;
and hardly were we alone before she turned to
me, exclaiming, with a vivacity and eagerness
very unusual to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Pauline, how strange you must think
my conduct has been lately, after what you have
seen to-day! But let me explain it to you. I
would have spoken openly to you weeks ago, if
I had had anything to tell; but I have been
kept as much in the dark as any one until to-day.
When we were children, Philip&mdash;Mr.
Marshall&mdash;and I were constantly together, and
became very much attached to each other; so
that when he went to West Point, though I was
but about eleven years old, we were regularly
and solemnly engaged. He did not return to
Louden until he had graduated; for, you know,
his father is poor, and they could not afford him
the money for the journey. Then he came, he
says, with the full intention of renewing our
childish engagement, if he found me so disposed;
but he thought he ought first to speak to my father
about it, as I was still so young, and father
objected so decidedly to anything of that kind
being said to me then, that Philip consented to
wait a little while. He came back in a year,
and, as soon as father heard of it, he sent me
down to New Orleans on a visit to my aunt. I
don't know how I discovered the truth; but I
did know very well the reason I was sent off so
hastily, and felt very badly about it. Then father
and Philip had another long talk, and Philip
promised to wait until I was eighteen before
he made any other attempt to speak to me about
what father calls our ridiculous engagement."</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "you were eighteen the day of
Mrs. Simmons's party&mdash;last Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Yes; and Philip tried to have an explanation
with me then; but he could not, for there
were so many people about. He was determined,
he said, this time not to see my father
until he had spoken to me, and he asked me
when he could see me alone for a little while.
I told him we had been talking of visiting Nannie
and Bettie for some time, and he said he
would accompany us, as they were cousins of
his, too&mdash;Virginia cousins, that is, not very near
ones."</p>

<p>"What can be your father's objection to Mr.
Marshall?" asked I.</p>

<p>"None at all to him; it is to his profession.
He wants me settled near him. He says I am
not strong enough to bear the wandering life
and hardships I shall have to encounter as an
officer's wife. I hope, though, that he will give
his consent, now that he sees by our constancy
how much we really do like each other. Just
think, dear, until to-day, I have hardly had five
minutes' uninterrupted conversation with Philip
since I was eleven, and our engagement was
never alluded to; and yet I never thought of
liking any one else, and I was sure his feelings
were unchanged; though, of course, until he
told me so, I could not speak of it even to my
dearest friend."</p>

<p>Before Virginia had finished her little romance,
my feelings of annoyance were all lost
in sympathy, and we passed the greater part of
the night discussing the manner in which Mr.
Percy would receive Mr. Marshall's third communication.
Virginia seemed to have but little
doubt of her father's consent, and neither had I;
for I had not yet met a Southern father who had
seemed able to refuse any child of his whatever
she had fixed her heart upon.</p>

<p>But in this case we were both disappointed.
Mr. Percy, usually calm and indulgent, seemed
irritated and displeased to an uncommon degree
when Mr. Marshall urged his request. He reminded
the young officer that he was entirely
dependent on his pay, which Mr. Percy said he
considered barely enough for one person; told
him that, owing to an unfortunate speculation
in buying a plantation in Arkansas, which had
turned out badly, and to the failure of his cotton
crop for the last two years, he had become very
much embarrassed, so that he should not be able
to assist his daughter, if she married, for some
time. He ended by repeating his former decision
that, accustomed as Virginia had been to
the ease and indulgences of a settled home, he
was sure she could never endure the discomforts
of a roving life. When she was twenty-one,
she might judge for herself; until that time, he
wished never to hear the subject mentioned
again.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall was very indignant, and tried
to persuade Virginia to renew her engagement
with him without her father's knowledge; but
to this she would not consent, and he was soon
afterwards obliged to return to his post.</p>

<p>Virginia was almost heartbroken at this sudden
rupture of a tie that had been formed in her
earliest childhood, and strengthened with every
subsequent year. I tried to persuade her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the three years which were to intervene before
she could make her own decision would pass
very quickly; but, hardly heeding my reasonings,
she gave herself up to hopeless despair.
She was sure, she said, her father never would
consent to her union with Philip, and she would
never marry without it. Besides, she did not
expect to live to be twenty-one. Long before
that time she should be in her grave.</p>

<p>At first, I paid no attention to these dismal
forebodings, thinking them only the natural expressions
of an affectionate heart suffering under
such a great disappointment. But gradually I
began to fear that they should be realized. She
would not eat, and grew pale and pined, and
her countenance began to wear an unearthly
look of patient sorrow and resignation that I
never observed without a pang. I knew that
her parents had noticed the alteration in Virginia's
health and spirits, for hardly a week
passed that some pleasant little excursion or
journey was not proposed to her. And thus the
long warm summer wore away.</p>

<p>One afternoon, late in September, I received a
note from her, saying that she had just returned
from a visit to the Mammoth Cave, and would
like to see me, to tell me about it. As I had not
seen her for three weeks, I hastened to Mr.
Percy's immediately, and running up to her
room, entered without knocking at the half-open
door.</p>

<p>Virginia was sitting in the full light of an
afternoon sun, whose rays were streaming in
unobstructed by shutters or curtain, seemingly
as if the occupant of the room had lost all thought
of bodily comfort. Her eyes were fixed on a
white cloud floating in the distant sky, and as
the wind lifted the heavy bands of hair from her
pallid temples, she looked so spiritualized and
incorporeal, that I should hardly have been surprised
if she had floated out to mingle with the
clouds on which she was gazing.</p>

<p>"Why, Virginia, have you been sick?" I
asked, after our first hurried greetings.</p>

<p>"No, dear; do I look badly?"</p>

<p>"Very," was my reply, sincere, if impolitic.</p>

<p>"I am rather glad to hear it," said Virginia,
"though of course it will be painful to me to
leave my father and mother, brothers and sisters;
still, I have so little to look forward to in this
world, that I cannot care to live. I feel, myself,
that I am growing weaker every day, and that
is one reason that I hurried home; I wanted to
see you and leave some messages with you for
Philip."</p>

<p>And Virginia went on to impress upon me a
variety of tender messages I was to remember
for Mr. Marshall. I tried to listen, but I hardly
heard what she said, for I was revolving in my
mind a bold undertaking. I knew that Mr.
Percy loved his daughter devotedly, and that if
once aware of her danger he would consent to
any means that seemed necessary for her recovery.
If I only dared to speak to him about
it&mdash;but I stood somewhat in awe of him, which
feeling I shared with his children and most of
his younger acquaintances. He had a certain
grand magnificent way with him that I have
never seen, excepting in Southern planters, and
but seldom in them. I imagine a Roman patrician
may have awed the populace, and impressed
the rude Gauls by somewhat the same air and
bearing.</p>

<p>However, the longer I listened to Virginia's
plaintive words and looked at her sorrowful face,
the more I felt that my reverence for her father
was being gradually lost in anger at what I considered
his cruel regardlessness of her feelings.
At last I left Virginia as abruptly as I had entered.
I had seen Mr. Percy as I passed, attending
to the grafting of some trees in the fruit orchard,
and there I bent my steps.</p>

<p>He greeted me with a pleasant smile, and offered
me a large Indian peach he had just gathered
from the tree. It almost seemed as if he wished
to propitiate me, for if I have a weakness it is
for peaches&mdash;and this particular kind, with its
deep red juicy pulp, was an especial favorite.
But I took it almost unconsciously, and, looking
at him earnestly, I said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Percy, Virginia is very ill."</p>

<p>He looked anxiously upon me.</p>

<p>"She will die," I continued, shaking my head
at him.</p>

<p>"Why, Pauline, do you really think so?"
asked he; and I could see that the alarm that had
been half roused for some time was now thoroughly
awake, and producing its effect.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do not see how she can recover&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Unless you send for Lieutenant Marshall
immediately."</p>

<p>"Don't you think Dr. Parkinson might do as
well?" asked he.</p>

<p>"No," I answered, shortly, looking upon that
question as most unkind trifling with mortal
need.</p>

<p>Every one knows the effect that decided impulsive
natures have on calm meditative ones.
An act Mr. Percy had been trying to make up
his mind to perform for some time, but had been
putting off, in hopes that secondary measures
might avail, he now consented to at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I shall have to do it," he said;
"you may tell Virginia so."</p>

<p>My work was but half done. Mr. Percy was
a most inveterate dawdle, to use Fanny Kemble's
expressive word. If left to himself, the letter
might be written in a week, but more probably
would be put off for a month. If we lived in
antediluvian times, this dilatory way of managing
matters might be of little consequence, but life
is too short now to afford the loss of even a few
weeks' happiness.</p>

<p>"Could you not write to Mr. Marshall now?
There is plenty of time to send it to the post-office
before dark."</p>

<p>Mr. Percy smiled, and yielded to my request
so far as to turn his steps towards the little
building dignified with the name of his office,
though I do not know what business he had to
transact there. He loitered by the way in a
manner that tired my patience to its utmost, and
once murmured something about having time to
graft another tree; but, heedless of his evident
desire to escape, I walked on with resolute purpose,
and, as you may have seen some stately
vessel, with furled sail, submissively yielding
herself up to be dragged into port by an energetic
little steamer, so did Mr. Perry resign himself to
the fate that had for once overtaken him&mdash;of
doing the right thing at the right time&mdash;and
seated himself at his writing-desk.</p>

<p>"How am I to know that Mr. Marshall has
not changed his mind?" asked Mr. Percy, before
beginning to write.</p>

<p>"Virginia showed me a letter just now that
she received from him a few hours ago, in which
he said that, although she would not consent to
any engagement without your approval, he still
and always should, as long as she remained single,
consider himself bound by his boyish promise."</p>

<p>"Desperately romantic!" said Mr. Percy, and
then the movement of his pen told me that he
had commenced the epistle that was to put an
end to so much sorrow.</p>

<p>Unable to remain quiet, I leaned out of the
window, and beckoned to a servant I saw loitering
at a little distance.</p>

<p>"Jack," said I, as he came near, "your master
is writing a letter, wait here until it is finished,
for he will want you to take it directly to the
post-office."</p>

<p>The order to wait was one too congenial to his
nature not to be readily obeyed, and discovering
at a glance the capabilities for enjoyment and
repose afforded by an inviting bed of hot sand
in which the afternoon sun was expending its
last fierce blaze, Jack threw himself down in it,
and I had soon the satisfaction of seeing that he
was sound asleep, and therefore in no danger of
being out of the way when he was wanted.</p>

<p>"Would you like to read the letter, Miss Pauline?"
asked Mr. Percy, when he had finished it.</p>

<p>I was very glad to avail myself of this permission.
I found that it contained a cordial, though
dignified invitation to Mr. Marshall to return to
Louden, with a full consent to the engagement
between Virginia and himself.</p>

<p>Giving the letter to Jack with directions to
put it in the post-office without delay, I hurried
to Virginia with the joyful tidings. I expected
a burst of tears and an infinitude of thanks. Instead
of either, when I had finished my story,
she said, in a slightly aggrieved tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Pauline, you told father I should
certainly die unless he sent for Philip. It will
make him think me so weak."</p>

<p>"Why, Virginia," I exclaimed, taken quite by
surprise, "what should I have said?"</p>

<p>"You might have said that I was not very
well, or something of that kind."</p>

<p>"And then he would have sent for Dr. Parkinson,
and the only result would have been a
few doses of calomel or quinine. No, dear, I
never once thought of your not being well. I
felt sure you would die, and I said so. I am
sorry it troubles you, but I think it was the best
thing I could do."</p>

<p>Virginia blushed the next time she saw her
father, as if he had been her lover instead; but,
as he said nothing to her on the subject, she gradually
recovered from her embarrassment, and
by the time Mr. Marshall joined her she had so
far recovered her health as to be able to enjoy
without a drawback what some people consider
the happiest part of one's life.</p>

<p>Mr. Percy did not relinquish his desire to have
his daughter settled near him, and one or two
successful years enabled him to effect his wishes.
Lieutenant Marshall was induced to resign from
the army, and with his wife and six children he
is now living and prospering on a plantation;
and in the substantial person of Mrs. Marshall,
anxious and troubled about many things in her
household and maternal concerns, I find it hard
to discover the least trace of the shadowy and
ethereal girl who had seemed to me at one time
much more a part of the spirit world than of this
material sphere.</p>

<h2><a name="GODEYS_COURSE_OF_LESSONS_IN_DRAWING" id="GODEYS_COURSE_OF_LESSONS_IN_DRAWING"></a>GODEY'S COURSE OF LESSONS IN DRAWING.</h2>

<p class="p8">LESSON II.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_115.jpg" width="416" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 11.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We now proceed to the drawing of curved
lines, as in Fig. 11. And as these are the basis
of innumerable forms, the pupil must not rest
satisfied with a few attempts at forming them;
she must try and try again, until she is able,
with a single sweep, to draw them correctly.
They must be done in one stroke, no piecing
being allowed. Let the curved line <em>a</em> be first
produced; beginning at the top, bring the arm
or wrist down, so that at one operation the form
may be traced; do this repeatedly, until the correct
outline is attained at every trial. The pupil
may next proceed to the curved line <em>b</em>, which
is merely the line <em>a</em> in another position; then,
after repeated trials, the lines <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>e</em>, <em>g</em>, and <em>h</em>
may be drawn. These curves should be attempted
to be drawn in all manner of positions,
beginning at the top, then at the bottom, and
making the curve upwards, and so on, until the
utmost facility is attained in drawing them,
howsoever placed. The curved line, generally
known as the "line of beauty," <em>f a b´</em>, must next
be mastered; it is of the utmost importance to
be able to do this easily and correctly. In all
these and the future elementary lessons, the
pupil must remember that when failing to draw
a form correctly, she should at once rub it out
or destroy it, and commence a new attempt.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_115a.jpg" width="366" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 12.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Having, then, acquired a ready facility in
drawing the simple elementary curved lines, the
pupil may next proceed to the combination of
these, as exemplified in simple figures, as circles
and ellipses, or ovals. First attempt to draw the
circle <em>a´ b</em>, Fig. 12; beginning at <em>a´</em>, sweep round
by the right down to <em>b</em>, then from <em>b</em> towards the
left and up to <em>a´</em>, where the circle was first begun.
The pupil may also try to draw it by going the
reverse way to the above. We are quite aware
that it will be found rather a difficult matter to
draw a circle correctly at the first, or rather even
after repeated attempts; but the pupil must not
be discouraged; by dint of practice she will be
able to draw circles of any size very correctly.
We have seen circles drawn by hand so that the
strictest test applied could scarcely point out an
error in their outline, so correctly were they put
in. Circles within circles may be drawn, as at
<em>c´</em>; care should be taken to have the lines at the
same distance from each other all round. The
ellipse <em>a b</em> must next be attempted; this is a form
eminently useful in delineating a multiplicity of
forms met with in practice. Ovals within ovals
may also be drawn, as at <em>c d</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>At this stage, the pupil ought to be able to
draw combinations of straight and curved lines,
as met with in many forms which may be presented
to her in after-practice. The examples
we intend now to place before her are all in
pure outline, having no reference to picturesque
arrangement, but designed to aid the pupil in
drawing outlines with facility; and to prove to
her, by a progression of ideas, that the most
complicated forms are but made up of lines of
extreme simplicity; that although in the aggregate
they may look complicated, in reality, when
carefully analyzed, they are amazingly simple.
Again, although the pupil may object to them as
being simple and formal&mdash;in fact, not picturesque
or decorative enough to please her hasty fancy&mdash;she
ought to recollect that, before being able to
delineate objects shown to her eye perspectively,
she must have a thorough knowledge of the method
of drawing the outlines of which the objects
are composed, and a facility in making the
hand follow aptly and readily the dictation of
the eye. These can be alone attained by a
steady application to elementary lessons.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 13.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 13 is the moulding, or form known in
architecture as the "echinus," or quarter-round.
First draw the line <em>a c</em>, then <em>b b</em> at the proper distance;
next mark with the eye the point <em>b</em> on
the line <em>b b</em>, to which the curve from <em>a</em> joins;
then put in the curve <em>a b</em> with one sweep. The
curved portion of the moulding in Fig. 14, known
as the "ogee," must be put in at one stroke of
the pencil or chalk, previously drawing the top
and bottom lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 14.</p></div>
</div>


<p>Fig. 15 is the "scotia;" it is formed geometrically
by two portions of a circle, but the pupil
should draw the curve at once with the hand.
It is rather a difficult one to draw correctly, but
practice will soon overcome the difficulty.</p>

</div>


<p>Should the pupil ever extend the practice of
the art beyond the simple lessons we have given
her, she will find, in delineating the outlines of
numerous subjects presented her, the vast utility
of the "practice" which we have placed before
her in the foregoing examples. In sketching
ancient or modern architectural edifices, she
will find the forms we have presented of frequent
recurrence.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to give examples of
the combinations of the forms or outlines we
have just noticed.</p>

<p>Fig. 17 is half of the base of an architectural
order frequently met with, called the "Doric."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 19.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 18 affords an exemplification of the outline
of part of a "cornice" belonging to the
Tuscan order. Let us slightly analyze the supposed
proceedings of the pupil in delineating
this. Suppose Fig. 19 to be the rough sketch
as first attempted. On examining the copy as
given in Fig. 18, the pupil will at once perceive
that the proportions are very incorrect;
thus, the distance between the two upper lines,
as at <em>d</em>, is too little, the fillet being too narrow;
again, the point <em>c</em>, which regulates the extent
of the curve from <em>a</em>, is too far from <em>a</em>, while
the line <em>c c´</em> is too near the line <em>d</em>; the space
between <em>c c´</em> and the line below it is too wide,
and the line <em>f</em> is not perpendicular, but slopes
outwards towards <em>f</em>; the distance between the
line <em>f g</em> and the one immediately above it is
also too narrow by at least one-third. Again,
the point <em>h</em>, where the portion of the circle begins,
is too near the point <em>f</em>; the line <em>i</em> is also
too near that of <em>f g</em>; the outline of the curve is
not correct, it being too much bulged out near
the point <em>k</em>; the line <em>n</em> is not straight, and that
marked <em>m</em> is too far from the extreme end of
the line. The pupil has here indicated a method
of analyzing her proceedings, comparing them
with the correct copy, which she would do well,
in her earlier practice, to use pretty frequently,
until she is perfectly at home in correct delineation
of outlines. It may be objected that this
analysis is hypercriticism utterly uncalled for,
from the simplicity of the practice; but let it be
noted that if the pupil is not able, or unwilling
to take the necessary trouble to enable her to
draw simple outlines correctly, how can she be
prevented, when she proceeds to more complicated
examples, from drawing difficult outlines
incorrectly? We hold that if a thing is worth
doing at all, it is worth doing well; and how
can a pupil do a thing correctly, unless from
correct models or rules? and how can she ascertain
whether she is following them, unless by
careful comparison and examination? How
often are the works of painters and artists found
fault with, from the incorrectness of outline, and
the inconsistency of measurement observable,
which might be obviated by a more careful attention
to the minute details, but are too frequently
spurned at by aspiring artists; but of
which, after all, the most complicated picture is
but a combination? Thus the outline in Fig. 19
presents all the lines and curves found in Fig. 18,
but the whole forms a delineation by no means
correct; and if a pupil is allowed to run from
simple lessons without being able to master them,
then the foundation of the art is sapped, and
the superstructure certainly endangered. Correct
outlining must be attained before the higher
examples of art can be mastered.</p>

<p>In the Celestial Empire, love matters are
managed by a confidant, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">billets-doux</i>
written to one another by the papas. At Amoy,
a marriage was recently concluded between the
respectable houses of Tan and O; on which occasion
the following epistles passed between the
two old gentlemen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From Papa Tan: "The ashamed young brother,
surnamed Tan, with washed head makes
obeisance, and writes this letter to the greatly
virtuous and honorable gentleman whose surname
is O. I duly reverence your lofty door.
The marriage business will be conducted according
to the six rules of propriety, and I will
reverently announce the business to my ancestors
with presents of gems and silks. I will arrange
the things received in your basket, so that all
who tread the threshold of my door may enjoy
them. From this time forward the two surnames
will be united, and I trust the union will be a
felicitous one, and last for a hundred years, and
realize the delight experienced by the union. I
hope that your honorable benevolence and consideration
will defend me unceasingly. At present
the dragon flies in Sin Hai term, the first
month, lucky day. I bow respectfully. Light
before. <span class="smcap shiftright">Tan.</span>"<br /></p></blockquote>

<p>From Papa O: "The younger brother, surnamed
O, of the family to be related by marriage,
washes his head clean, knocks his head and bows,
and writes this marriage-letter in reply to the
far-famed and virtuous gentleman surnamed Tan,
the venerable teacher and great man who manages
his business. 'Tis matter for congratulation
the union of 100 years. I reverence your lofty
gate. The prognostic is good, also the divination
of the lucky bird. The stars are bright, and the
dragons meet together. I, the foolish one, am
ashamed of my diminutiveness. I for a long
time have desired your dragon powers: now you
have not looked down upon me with contempt,
but have entertained the statements of the match-maker,
and agree to give Kang to be united to
my despicable daughter. We all wish the girl
to have her hair dressed, and the young man to
put on his cap of manhood. The peach-flowers
just now look beautiful, the red plum also
looks gay. I praise your son, who is like a fairy
horse who can cross over through water, and is
able to ride upon the wind and waves; but my
tiny daughter is like a green window and a feeble
plant, and is not worthy of becoming the subject
of verse.</p>

<p>"Now, I reverently bow to your good words,
and make use of them to display your good
breeding. Now, I hope your honorable benevolence
will always remember me without end.
Now the dragon flies in the Sin Hai term, first
month, lucky day. Obeisance! May the future
be prosperous. <span class="shiftright">O."</span><br /></p>

<h2><a name="THE_TRIALS_OF_A_NEEDLEWOMAN" id="THE_TRIALS_OF_A_NEEDLEWOMAN"></a>THE TRIALS OF A NEEDLEWOMAN.</h2>

<p class="p8">BY T. S. ARTHUR.</p>


<p class="p6">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>Needle-work, at best, yields but a small
return. Yet how many thousands have no other
resource in life, no other barrier thrown up between
them and starvation! The manly stay
upon which a woman has leaned suddenly fails,
and she finds self-support an imperative necessity;
yet she has no skill, no strength, no developed
resources. In all probability, she is a
mother. In this case, she must not only stand
alone, but sustain her helpless children. Since
her earliest recollection, others have ministered
to her wants and pleasures. From a father's
hand, childhood and youth received their countless
natural blessings; and brother or husband,
in later years, has stood between her and the
rough winds of a stormy world. All at once,
like a bird reared from a fledgling in its cage,
and then turned loose in dreary winter time,
she finds herself in the world unskilled in its
ways, yet required to earn her bread or perish.</p>

<p>What can she do? In what art or profession
has she been educated? The world demands
service, and proffers its money for labor. But
what has she learned? What work can she
perform? She can sew. And is that all?
Every woman we meet can ply the needle.
Ah! As a seamstress, how poor the promise for
her future! The labor market is crowded with
sewing women, and, as a consequence, the price
of needle-work&mdash;more particularly that called
plain needle-work&mdash;is depressed to mere starvation
rates. In the more skilled branches, better
returns are met; but, even here, few can endure
prolonged application&mdash;few can bend ten, twelve,
or fifteen hours daily over their tasks, without
fearful inroads upon health.</p>

<p>In the present time, a strong interest has been
awakened on this subject. The cry of the poor
seamstress has been heard; and the questions,
"How shall we help her?" "How shall we
widen the circle of remunerative employments for
women?" passes anxiously from lip to lip. To
answer this question is not our present purpose.
Others are earnestly seeking to work out the
problem, and we must leave the solution with
them. What we now design is to quicken their
generous impulses. How more effectively can
this be done than by a life-picture of the poor
needlewoman's trials and sufferings? And this
we shall now proceed to give.</p>

<p>It was a cold, dark, drizzly day in the fall of
18&mdash;, that a young female entered a well-arranged
clothing store in Boston, and passed with
hesitating steps up to where a man was standing
behind one of the counters.</p>

<p>"Have you any work, sir?" she asked, in a
low, timid voice.</p>

<p>The individual to whom this was addressed, a
short, rough-looking man, with a pair of large
black whiskers, eyed her for a moment with a
bold stare, and then indicated, by half turning
his head and nodding sideways towards the
owner of the shop, who stood at a desk some
distance back, that her application was to be
made there. Turning quickly from the rude,
and too familiar gaze of the attendant, the young
woman went on to the desk, and stood, half
frightened and trembling, beside the man from
whom she had come to ask the privilege of toiling
for little more than a crust of bread and a
cup of cold water.</p>

<p>"Have you any work, sir?" was repeated in
a still lower and more timid voice than that in
which her request had at first been made.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have," was the gruff reply.</p>

<p>"Can I get some?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm not sure that you'll
ever bring it back again."</p>

<p>The applicant endeavored to make some reply
to this, but the words choked her; she could
not utter them.</p>

<p>"I've been tricked in my time out of more
than a little by new-comers. But I don't know;
you seem to have a simple, honest look. Are
you particularly in want of work?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir!" replied the applicant, in an
earnest, half-imploring voice. "I desire work
very much."</p>

<p>"What kind do you want?"</p>

<p>"Almost anything you have to give out, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, we have pants, coarse and fine roundabouts,
shirts, drawers, and almost any article
of men's wear you can mention."</p>

<p>"What do you give for shirts, sir?"</p>

<p>"Various prices; from six cents up to twenty
five, according to the quality of the article."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only twenty-five cents for fine shirts!" returned
the young woman, in a surprised, disappointed,
desponding tone.</p>

<p>"<em>Only</em> twenty-five cents? <em>Only?</em> Yes, <em>only</em>
twenty-five cents! Pray, how much did you
expect to get, Miss?" retorted the clothier, in a
half sneering, half offended voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But twenty-five cents is
very little for a hard day's work."</p>

<p>"Is it, indeed? I know enough who are
thankful for even that. Enough who are at it
early and late, and do not even earn as much.
Your ideas will have to come down a little,
Miss, if you expect to work for this branch of
business."</p>

<p>"What do you give for vests and pantaloons?"
asked the woman, without seeming to notice
the man's rudeness.</p>

<p>"For common trowsers with pockets, twelve
cents; and for finer ones, fifteen and twenty
cents. Vests about the same rates."</p>

<p>"Have you any shirts ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a plenty. Will you have 'em coarse
or fine?"</p>

<p>"Fine, if you please."</p>

<p>"How many will you take?"</p>

<p>"Let me have three to begin with."</p>

<p>"Here, Michael," cried the man to the attendant
who had been first addressed by the
stranger, "give this girl three fine shirts to
make." Then turning to her, he said, "They
are cotton shirts, with linen collars, bosoms, and
wristbands. There must be two rows of stitching
down the bosoms, and one row upon the
wristband. Collars plain. And remember, they
must be made very nice."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the reply, made in a sad
voice, as the young creature turned from her
employer and went up to the shop-attendant to
receive the three shirts.</p>

<p>"You've never worked for the clothing stores,
I should think?" remarked this individual, looking
her in the face with a steady gaze.</p>

<p>"Never," replied the applicant, in a low tone,
half shrinking away, with an instinctive aversion
for the man.</p>

<p>"Well, it's pretty good when one can't do
any better. An industrious sewer can get along
pretty well upon a pinch."</p>

<p>No reply was made to this. The shirts were
now ready; but, before they were handed to
her, the man bent over the counter, and, putting
his face close to hers, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What might your name be, Miss?"</p>

<p>A quick flush suffused the neck and face of
the girl, as she stepped back a pace or two, and
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is of no consequence, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, but it is of consequence. We
never give out work to people who don't tell
their names. We would be a set of unconscionable
fools to do that, I should think."</p>

<p>The young woman stood thoughtful for a little
while, and then said, while her cheek still
burned&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lizzy Glenn."</p>

<p>"Very well. And now, Miss Lizzy, be kind
enough to inform me where you live."</p>

<p>"That is altogether unnecessary. I will bring
the work home as soon as I have finished it."</p>

<p>"But suppose you should happen to forget
our street and number? What then?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I shall not do that. I know the
place very well," was the innocent reply.</p>

<p>"No, but that won't do, Lizzy. We must
have the name and place of residence of every
man, woman, and child who work for us. It is
our rule, and we never depart from it."</p>

<p>There was another brief period of irresolution,
and then the place of abode was given. This
was first entered, with her name, in a book, and
then the three shirts were handed over. The
seamstress turned away on receiving them, and
walked quickly from the shop.</p>

<p>The appearance of this young applicant for
work would have appealed instantly to the sympathies
of any one but a regular slop-shop man,
who looked only to his own profits, and cared
not a fig whose heart-drops cemented the stones
of his building. She was tall and slender, with
light brown hair, clear soft complexion, and
eyes of a mild hazel. But her cheeks were
sunken, though slightly flushed, and her eyes
lay far back in their sockets. Her forehead was
high and very white. The tones of her voice,
which was low, were soft and musical, and her
words were spoken, few though they were, with
a taste and appropriateness that showed her to
be one who had moved in a circle of refinement
and intelligence. As to her garments,
they were old, and far too thin for the season.
A light, faded shawl, of costly material, was
drawn closely around her shoulders, but had not
the power to keep from her attenuated frame
the chill air, or to turn off the fine penetrating
rain that came with the wind, searchingly, from
the bleak north-east. Her dress, of summer
calico, much worn, clung closely to her body.
Above all was a close bonnet, and a thick veil,
which she drew around her face as she stepped
into the street and glided hurriedly away.</p>

<p>"She's a touch above the vulgar, Michael,"
broke in Berlaps, the owner of the shop, coming
forward as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! That craft has been taut
rigged in her time."</p>

<p>"Who can she be, Michael? None of your
common ones, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh no, of course not; she's 'seen better
days,' as the slang phrase is."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that. What name did she give?"</p>

<p>"Lizzy Glenn. But that may or may not be
correct. People like her are sometimes apt to
forget even their own names."</p>

<p>"Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"In the lower part of the town somewhere.
I have it in the book here."</p>

<p>"You think she'll bring them shirts back?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Folks that have come down in the
world as she has rarely play grab game after that
fashion."</p>

<p>"She seemed all struck aback at the price."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"But she's the right kind," resumed Berlaps.
"I only wish we had a dozen like her."</p>

<p>"I wish we had. Her work will never rip."</p>

<p>Further conversation was prevented by the
entrance of a customer. Before he had been
fully served, a middle-aged woman came in with
a large bundle, and went back to Berlaps's desk,
where he stood engaged over his account-books.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mrs. Gaston," said he, looking
up, while not a feature relaxed on his cold, rigid
countenance.</p>

<p>"I've brought you in six pairs of pants," said
the woman, untying the bundle she had laid
upon the counter.</p>

<p>"You had seven pair, ma'am."</p>

<p>"I know that, Mr. Berlaps. But only six are
finished; and, as I want some money, I have
brought them in."</p>

<p>"It is more than a week since we gave them
out. You ought to have had the whole seven
pair done. We want them all now. They
should have been in day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"They would have been finished, Mr. Berlaps,"
said the woman, in a deprecating tone;
"but one of my children has been sick, and I
have had to be up with her so often every night,
and have had to attend to her so much through
the day, that I have not been able to do more
than half work."</p>

<p>"Confound the children!" muttered the tailor
to himself, as he began inspecting the woman's
work. "They're always getting sick, or something
else."</p>

<p>After carefully examining three or four pairs
of the coarse trowsers which had been brought
in, he pushed the whole from him with a quick
impatient gesture and an angry scowl, saying, as
he did so&mdash;</p>

<p>"Botched to death! I can't give you work
unless it's done better, Mrs. Gaston. You grow
worse and worse!"</p>

<p>"I know, sir," replied the woman, in a troubled
voice, "that they are not made quite so
well as they might be. But consider how much
I have had against me. A sick child&mdash;and worn
out by attendance on her night and day."</p>

<p>"It's always a sick child, or some other excuse
with the whole of you. But that don't
answer me. I want my work done well, and
I mean to have it so. If you don't choose to
turn out good work, I can find a plenty who
will."</p>

<p>"You sha'n't complain of me hereafter, Mr.
Berlaps," replied the woman, submissively.</p>

<p>"So you have said before. But we shall see."</p>

<p>Berlaps then turned moodily to his desk, and
resumed the employment he had broken off
when the seamstress came in, while she stood
with her hands folded across each other, awaiting
his pleasure in regard to the payment of the
meagre sum she had earned by a full week of
hard labor, prolonged often to a late hour in the
night. She had stood thus, meekly, for nearly
five minutes, when Berlaps raised his head, and
looking at her sternly over the top of his desk,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for, Mrs. Gaston?"</p>

<p>"I should like to have the money for the
pants I have brought in. I am out of every"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never pay until the whole job is done.
Bring in the other pair, and you can have your
money."</p>

<p>"Yes; but Mr. Berlaps"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You needn't talk anything about it, madam.
You have my say," was the tailor's angry response.</p>

<p>Slowly turning away, the woman moved, with
hesitating steps, to the door, paused there a
moment, and then went out. She lingered along,
evidently undecided how to act, for several minutes,
and then moved on at a quicker pace, as
if doubt and irresolution had given way to some
encouraging thought. Threading her way along
the narrow winding streets in the lower part of
the city, she soon emerged into the open space
used as a hay-market, and, crossing over this,
took her way in the direction of one of the
bridges. Before reaching this, she turned down
towards the right and entered a small grocery.
A woman was the only attendant upon this.</p>

<p>"Won't you trust me for a little more, Mrs.
Grubb?" she asked, in a supplicating voice,
while she looked anxiously into her face.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am! not one cent till that dollar's
paid up!" was the sharp retort. "And, to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you the truth, I think you've got a heap of impudence
to come in here, bold-faced, and ask for
more trust, after having promised me over and
over again for a month to pay that dollar. No!
pay the dollar first!"</p>

<p>"I did intend to pay you a part of it this very
day," replied Mrs. Gaston. "But"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh yes. It's but this, and but that. But,
buts ain't my dollar. I'm an honest woman,
and want to make an honest living; and must
have my money."</p>

<p>"But I only want a little, Mrs. Grubb. A
few potatoes and some salt fish; and just a gill
of milk and a cup of flour. The children have
had nothing to eat since yesterday. I took home
six pairs of trowsers to-day, which came to
ninety cents, at fifteen cents a pair. But I had
seven pairs, and Mr. Berlaps won't pay me until
I bring the whole number. It will take me till
twelve o'clock to-night to finish them, and so I
can't get any money before to-morrow. Just let
me have two pounds of salt fish, which will be
only seven cents, and three cents' worth of potatoes;
and a little milk and flour to make
something for Ella. It won't be much, Mrs.
Grubb, and it will keep the little ones from
being hungry all day and till late to-morrow."</p>

<p>Her voice failed her as she uttered the last
sentence. But she restrained herself after the
first sob that heaved her overladen bosom, and
stood calmly awaiting the answer to her urgent
petition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grubb was a woman, and a mother into
the bargain. She had, too, the remains of a woman's
heart, where lingered a few maternal
sympathies. These were quick to prompt her
to duty. Turning away without a reply, she
weighed out two pounds of fish, measured a peck
of potatoes, poured out some milk in a cup, and
filled a small paper with flour. These she
handed to Mrs. Gaston without uttering a word.</p>

<p>"To-morrow you shall be paid for these, and
something on the old account," said the recipient,
as she took them and hurried from the
shop.</p>

<p>"Why not give up at once, instead of trying
to keep soul and body together by working for
the slop-shops?" muttered Mrs. Grubb, as her
customer withdrew. "She'd a great sight better
go with her children to the poor-house than
keep them half starving under people's noses at
this rate, and compelling us, who have a little feeling
left, to keep them from dying outright with
hunger! It's too bad! There's that Berlaps,
who grinds the poor seamstresses, who work for
him to death, and makes them one-half of their
time beggars at our stores for something for
their children to eat. He is building two houses
in Roxbury at this very moment; and out of
what? Out of the money of which he has
robbed these poor women. Fifteen cents for a
pair of trowsers with pockets in them! Ten
cents for shirts and drawers; and everything at
that rate! Is it any wonder they are starving,
and he growing rich? Curse him, and all like
him! I could see them hung!"</p>

<p>And the woman set her teeth and clenched
her hand in momentary, but impotent rage.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Mrs. Gaston hurried home
with the food she had obtained. She occupied
the upper room of a narrow frame house near
the river, for which she paid a rent of three
dollars a month. It was small and comfortless;
but the best her slender means could provide.
Two children were playing on the floor when
she entered, the one about four, and the other a
boy who looked as if he might be nearly ten
years of age. On the bed lay Ella, the sick
child to whom the mother had alluded both to
the tailor and the shop-keeper. She turned
wishfully upon her mother her young bright
eyes as she entered, but did not move or utter a
word. The children, who had been amusing
themselves upon the floor, sprang to their feet,
and, catching hold of the basket she brought in
with her, ascertained in a moment its contents.</p>

<p>"Fish and taters! fish and taters!" cried the
youngest, a little girl, clapping her hands and
dancing about the floor.</p>

<p>"Won't we have some dinner now?" said
Henry, the oldest boy, looking up into his mother's
face with eager delight, as he laid his
hands upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Yes, my children, you shall have a good
dinner, and that right quickly," returned the
mother, in a voice half choked with emotion, as
she threw off her bonnet and proceeded to cook
the coarse provisions she had obtained at the
sacrifice of so much feeling. It did not take
long to boil the fish and potatoes, which were
eaten with a keen relish by two of the children,
Emma and Harry. The gruel prepared for Ella,
from the flour obtained at Mrs. Grubb's, did
not much tempt the sickly appetite of the child.
She sipped a few spoonfuls, and then turned
from the bowl which her mother held for her at
the bedside.</p>

<p>"Eat more of it, dear," said Mrs. Gaston.
"It will make you feel better."</p>

<p>"I'm not very hungry now, mother," answered Ella.</p>

<p>"Don't it taste good to you?"</p>

<p>"Not very good."</p>

<p>The child sighed as she turned her wan face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
towards the wall, and the unhappy mother
sighed responsive.</p>

<p>"I wish you would try to take a little more.
It's so long since you have eaten anything; and
you'll grow worse if you don't take nourishment.
Just two or three spoonfuls. Come,
dear."</p>

<p>Ella, thus urged, raised herself in bed, and
made an effort to eat more of the gruel. At the
third spoonful, her stomach heaved as the tasteless
fluid touched her lips.</p>

<p>"Indeed, mother, I can't swallow another
mouthful," she said, again sinking back on her
pillow.</p>

<p>Slowly did Mrs. Gaston turn from the bed.
She had not yet eaten of the food which her
two well children were devouring with the
eagerness of hungry animals. Only a small
portion did she now take for herself, and that
was eaten hurriedly, as if the time occupied in
attending to her own wants were so much
wasted.</p>

<p>The meal over, Mrs. Gaston took the unfinished
pair of trowsers, and, though feeling
weary and disheartened, bent earnestly to the
task before her. At this she toiled, unremittingly,
until the falling twilight admonished her
to stop. The children's supper was then prepared.
She would have applied to Mrs. Grubb
for a loaf of bread, but was so certain of meeting
a refusal that she refrained from doing so. For
supper, therefore, they had only the salt fish and
potatoes.</p>

<p>It was one o'clock that night before exhausted
nature refused another draft upon its energies.
The garment was not quite finished. But the
nerveless hand and the weary head of the poor
seamstress obeyed the requirements of her will
no longer. The needle had to be laid aside, for
the finger had no more strength to grasp, nor
skill to direct its motions.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p6">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock on the next morning,
when Mrs. Gaston appeared at the shop of
Berlaps, the tailor.</p>

<p>"Here is the other pair," she said, as she
came up to the counter, behind which stood
Michael, the salesman.</p>

<p>That person took the pair of trowsers, glanced
at them a moment, and then, tossing them aside,
asked Mrs. Gaston if she could make some cloth
roundabouts.</p>

<p>"At what price?" was inquired.</p>

<p>"The usual price&mdash;thirty cents."</p>

<p>"Thirty cents for cloth jackets! Indeed,
Michael, that is too little. You used to give
thirty-seven and a half."</p>

<p>"Can't afford to do it now, then. Thirty
cents is enough. There are plenty of women
glad to get them even at that price."</p>

<p>"But it will take me a full day and a half to
make a cloth jacket, Michael."</p>

<p>"You work slow, that's the reason; a good
sewer can easily make one in a day; and that's
doing pretty well, these times."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by pretty well,
Michael," answered the seamstress. "How do
you think you could manage to support yourself
and three children on less than thirty cents a
day?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you put that oldest boy of yours
out yet?" asked Michael, instead of replying to
the question of Mrs. Gaston.</p>

<p>"No, I have not."</p>

<p>"Well, you do very wrong, let me tell you,
to slave yourself and pinch your other children
for him, when he might be earning his living
just as well as not. He's plenty old enough to
be put out."</p>

<p>"You may think so, but I don't. He is still
but a child."</p>

<p>"A pretty big child, I should say. But, if
you would like to get him a good master, I know
a man over in Cambridge who would take him
off of your hands."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He keeps a store, and wants just such a boy
to do odd trifles about, and run of errands. It
would be the very dandy for your little fellow.
He'll be in here to-day, and, if you say so, I
will speak to him about your son."</p>

<p>"I would rather try and keep him with me
this winter. He is too young to go so far away.
I could not know whether he were well or ill
used."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, ma'am, the man I spoke of
is a particular friend of mine, and I know him
to be as kind-hearted as a woman. His wife's
amiability and good temper are proverbial. Do
let me speak a good word for your son; I'm
sure you will never repent it."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it, Michael; but don't believe
I shall feel satisfied to let Henry go anywhere
out of Boston, even if I should be forced
to get him a place away from home this winter."</p>

<p>"Well, you can do as you please, Mrs. Gaston,"
said Michael, in a half offended tone. "I
shall not charge anything for my advice. But
say! do you intend trying some of these jackets?"</p>

<p>"Can't you give me some more pantaloons?
I can do better on them, I think."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"We sha'n't have any more coarse trowsers
ready for two or three days. The jackets are
your only chance."</p>

<p>"If I must, I suppose I must, then," replied
Mrs. Gaston to this, in a desponding tone. "So
let me have a couple of them."</p>

<p>The salesman took from a shelf two dark,
heavy cloth jackets, cut out and tied up in separate
bundles with a strip of the fabric from
which they had been taken. As he handed
them to the woman, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remember, now, these are to be made extra
nice."</p>

<p>"You shall have no cause of complaint&mdash;depend
upon that, Michael. But isn't Mr. Berlaps
in this morning?"</p>

<p>"No. He's gone out to Roxbury to see about
some houses he is putting up there."</p>

<p>"You can pay me for them pantys, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No. I never settle any bills in his absence."</p>

<p>"But it's a very small matter, Michael. Only
a dollar and five cents," said Mrs. Gaston, earnestly,
her heart sinking in her bosom.</p>

<p>"Can't help it. It's just as I tell you."</p>

<p>"When will Mr. Berlaps be home?"</p>

<p>"Some time this afternoon, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not till this afternoon," murmured the mother,
sadly, as she thought of her children, and
how meagerly she had been able to provide for
them during the past few days. Turning away
from the counter, she left the store and hurried
homeward. Henry met her at the door as she
entered, and, seeing that she brought nothing
with her but the small bundles of work, looked
disappointed. This touched her feeling a good
deal. But she felt much worse when Ella, the
sick one, half raised herself from her pillow and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you get me that orange as you promised,
mother?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; I couldn't get any money this
morning," the mother replied, bending over her
sick child and kissing her cheek, that was
flushed and hot with fever. "But as soon as
Mr. Berlaps pays me you shall have an orange."</p>

<p>"I wish he would pay you soon, then, mother;
for I want one so bad. I dreamed last
night that I had one, and, just as I was going to
eat it, I waked up. And, since you have been
gone, I've been asleep, and dreamed again that
I had a large juicy orange. But don't cry, mother.
I know you couldn't get it for me. I'll
be very patient."</p>

<p>"I know you will, my dear child," said the
mother, putting an arm about the little sufferer,
and drawing her to her bosom; "you have been
good and patient, and mother is only sorry that
she has not been able to get you the orange you
want so badly."</p>

<p>"But I don't believe I want it so very, very
bad, mother, as I seem to. I think about it so
much&mdash;that's the reason I want it, I'm sure.
I'll try and not think about it any more."</p>

<p>"Try, that's a dear, good girl," murmured
Mrs. Gaston, as she kissed her child again, and
then turned away to resume once more her
wearying task. Unrolling one of the coarse
jackets she had brought home, she found that it
was of heavy beaver cloth, and had to be sewed
with strong thread. For a moment or two, after
she spread it out upon the table, she looked at
the many pieces to be wrought up into a well-finished
whole, and thought of the hours of hard
labor it would require to accomplish the task.
A feeling of discouragement stole into her heart,
and she leaned her head listlessly upon the table.
But only a moment or two elapsed before a
thought of her children aroused her flagging
energies.</p>

<p>It was after eleven o'clock before she was
fairly at work. The first thing to be done, after
laying aside the different portions of the garment
in order, was to put in the pockets. This was
not accomplished before one o'clock, when she
had to leave her work to prepare a meal for herself
and little ones. There remained from their
supper and breakfast a small portion of the fish
and potatoes. Both of these had been boiled,
and hashed up together, and, of what remained,
all that was required was to make it into balls
and fry it. This was not a matter to occasion
much delay. In fifteen minutes from the time
she laid aside her needle and thimble, the table
had been set, with its one dish upon it, and
Harry and little Emma were eating with keen
appetites their simple meal. But, to Mrs. Gaston,
the food was unpalatable; and Ella turned
from it with loathing. There was, however,
nothing more in the house; and both Ella and
her mother had to practice self-denial and patience.</p>

<p>After the table was cleared away, Mrs. Gaston
again resumed her labor; but Emma was unusually
fretful, and hung about her mother nearly
the whole afternoon, worrying her mind, and
keeping her back a good deal, so that, when the
brief afternoon had worn away, and the deepening
twilight compelled her to suspend her labors,
she had made but little perceptible progress
in her work.</p>

<p>"Be good children now until I come back,"
she said, as she rose from her chair, put on her
bonnet, and drew an old Rob Roy shawl around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
her shoulders. Descending then into the street,
she took her way with a quick step towards that
part of the city in which her employer kept his
store. Her heart beat anxiously as she drew
near, and trembled lest she should not find him
in. If not?&mdash;but the fear made her feel sick.
She had no food in the house, no friends to
whom she could apply, and there was no one of
whom she could venture to ask to be trusted for
even a single loaf of bread. At length she
reached the well-lighted store, in which were
several customers, upon whom both Berlaps and
his clerk were attending with business assiduity.
The sight of the tailor relieved the feelings of
poor Mrs. Gaston very much. Passing on to
the back part of the store, she stood patiently
awaiting his leisure. But his customers were
hard to please. And, moreover, one was scarcely
suited before another came in. Thus it continued
for nearly half an hour, when the poor
woman became so anxious about the little ones
she had left at home, and especially about Ella,
who had appeared to have a good deal of fever
when she came away, that she walked slowly
down the store, and paused opposite to where
Berlaps stood waiting upon a customer, in order
to attract his attention. But he took not the
slightest notice of her. She remained thus for
nearly ten minutes longer. Then she came up
to the side of the counter, and, leaning over towards
him, said, in a half whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can I speak a word with you, Mr. Berlaps?"</p>

<p>"I've no time to attend to you now, woman,"
he answered, gruffly, and the half frightened
creature shrunk away quickly, and again stood
far back in the store.</p>

<p>It was full half an hour after this before the
shop was cleared, and then the tailor, instead of
coming back to where Mrs. Gaston stood, commenced
folding up and replacing his goods upon
the shelves. Fearful lest other customers would
enter, the seamstress came slowly forward, and
again stood near Berlaps.</p>

<p>"What do you want here to-night, woman?"
asked the tailor, without lifting his eyes from
the employment in which he was engaged.</p>

<p>"I brought home the other pair of trowsers
this morning, but you were not in," Mrs. Gaston
replied.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Michael couldn't pay me, and so I've run
up this evening."</p>

<p>"You're a very troublesome kind of a person,"
said Berlaps, looking her rebukingly in
the face. Then taking a dollar and five cents
from the drawer, he pushed them towards her
on the counter, adding, as he did so, "There,
take your money. One would think you were
actually starving."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston picked up the coin eagerly, and
hurried away. It was more than an hour since
she had left home. Her children were alone,
and the night had closed in some time before.
The thought of this made her quicken her pace
to a run. As she passed on, the sight of an
orange in a window reminded her of her promise
to Ella. She stopped and bought a small
one, and then hurried again on her way.</p>

<p>"Here's half a dollar of what I owe you, Mrs.
Grubb," said she, as she stepped into the shop
of that personage, and threw the coin she named
upon the counter. "And now give me a loaf
of bread, quickly; some molasses in this cup,
and a pint of milk in this," drawing two little
mugs from under her shawl as she spoke.</p>

<p>The articles she mentioned were soon ready
for her. She had paid for them, and was about
stepping from the door, when she paused, and,
turning about, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I had like to have forgotten! I want
two cent candles. I shall have to work late to-night."</p>

<p>The candles were cut from a large bunch
hanging above the narrow counter, wrapped in
a very small bit of paper, and given to Mrs.
Gaston, who took them and went quickly away.</p>

<p>All was dark and still in the room that contained
her children, as she gained the house that
sheltered them. She lit one of her candles below,
and went up stairs. As she entered, Ella's
bright eyes glistened upon her from the bed;
but little Emma had fallen asleep with her head
in the lap of Henry, who was seated upon the
floor with his back against the wall, himself
likewise locked in the arms of forgetfulness.
The fire had nearly gone out, and the room was
quite cold.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, why did you stay so long?"
Ella asked, looking her earnestly in the face.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get back any sooner, my dear.
But see! I've brought the orange you have
wished for so long. You can eat it all by yourself,
for Emma is fast asleep on the floor, and
can't cry for it."</p>

<p>But Emma roused up at the moment, and began
to fret and cry for something to eat.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, dear. You shall have your supper
in a little while. I have brought you home
some nice bread and molasses," said the mother,
in tones meant to soothe and quiet her hungry
and impatient little one. But Emma continued
to fret and cry on.</p>

<p>"It's so cold, mamma!" she said. "It's so
cold, and I'm hungry!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't cry, dear," again urged the mother.
"I'll make the fire up nice and warm in a little
while, and then you shall have something
good to eat."</p>

<p>But&mdash;"It's so cold, mamma! it's so cold!
and I'm hungry!" was the continued and incessant
complaint of the poor child.</p>

<p>All this time, Ella had been busily engaged in
peeling her orange and dividing it into four
quarters.</p>

<p>"See here, Emma! Look what I've got!"
she said, in a lively, cheerful tone, as soon as
her orange had been properly divided. "Come,
cover up in bed here with me, until the fire's
made, and you shall have this nice bit of orange."</p>

<p>Emma's complaints ceased in a moment, and
she turned towards her sister, and clambered
upon the bed.</p>

<p>"And here's a piece for you, Henry, and a
piece for mother, too," continued Ella, reaching
out two other portions.</p>

<p>"No, dear, keep it for yourself. I don't want
it," said the mother.</p>

<p>"And Emma shall have my piece," responded
Henry; "she wants it worse than I do."</p>

<p>"That is right. Be good children, and love
one another," said Mrs. Gaston, encouragingly.
"But Emma don't want brother Henry's piece,
does she?"</p>

<p>"No, Emma don't want brother Henry's
piece," repeated the child; and she took up a
portion of the orange as she spoke, and handed
it to her brother.</p>

<p>Henry received it, and, getting upon the bed
with his sisters, shared with them not only
the orange, but kind fraternal feelings. The
taste of the fruit revived Ella a good deal, and
she, with the assistance of Henry, succeeded in
amusing Emma until their mother had made the
fire and boiled some water. Into a portion of
the water she poured about half of the milk she
had brought home, and, filling a couple of tin
cups with this, set it with bread and molasses
upon a little table, and called Henry and Emma
to supper. The children, at this announcement,
scrambled from the bed, and, pushing chairs up
to the table, commenced eating the supper provided
for them with keen appetites. Into what
remained of the pint of milk, Mrs. Gaston
poured a small portion of hot water, and then
crumbled some bread, and put a few grains of
salt into it, and took this to the bed for Ella.
The child ate two or three spoonfuls; but her
stomach soon turned against the food.</p>

<p>"I don't feel hungry, mother," said she, as
she laid herself back upon the pillow.</p>

<p>"But you've eaten scarcely anything to-day.
Try and take a little more, dear. It will do you
good."</p>

<p>"I can't, indeed, mother." And a slight expression
of loathing passed over the child's face.</p>

<p>"Can't you think of something you could
eat?" urged the mother.</p>

<p>"I don't want anything. The orange tasted
good, and that is enough for to-night," Ella replied,
in a cheerful voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston then sat down by the table with
Henry and Emma, and ate a small portion of
bread and molasses. But this food touched not
her palate with any pleasurable sensation. She
ate only because she knew that, unless she took
food, she would not have strength to perform
her duties to her children. For a long series of
years, her system had been accustomed to the
generous excitement of tea at the evening meal.
A cup of good tea had become almost indispensable
to her. It braced her system, cleared her
head, and refreshed her after the unremitting
toils of the day. But, for some time past, she
had felt called upon, for the sake of her children,
to deny herself this luxury&mdash;no, comfort&mdash;no,
this, to her, one of the necessaries of life. The
consequence was that her appetite lost its tone.
No food tasted pleasantly to her; and the labors
of the evening were performed under depression
of spirits and nervous relaxation of body.</p>

<p>This evening she ate, compulsorily, as usual,
a small portion of dry bread, and drank a few
mouthfuls of warm water in which a little milk
had been poured. As she did so, her eyes turned
frequently upon the face of Henry, a fair-haired,
sweet-faced, delicate boy, her eldest born&mdash;the
first pledge of pure affection, and the promise of
a happy wedded life. Sadly, indeed, had time
changed since then. A young mother, smiling
over her first born&mdash;how full of joy was the
sunlight of each succeeding day! Now, widowed
and alone, struggling with failing and unequal
strength against the tide that was slowly bearing
her down the stream, each morning broke to her
more and more drearily, and each evening, as it
closed darkly in, brought another shadow to
rest in despondency upon her spirit. Faithfully
had she struggled on, hoping still to be able to
keep her little ones around her. The proposition
of Michael to put out Henry startled into
activity the conscious fear that had for some
months been stifled in her bosom; and now she
had to look the matter full in the face, and, in
spite of all her feelings of reluctance, confess to
herself that the effort to keep her children
around her must prove unavailing. But how
could she part with her boy? How could she
see him put out among strangers? How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
she bear to let him go away from her side, and
be henceforth treated as a servant, and be compelled
to perform labor above his years? The
very thought made her sick.</p>

<p>Her frugal meal was soon finished, and then
the children were put to bed. After laying away
their clothes, and setting back the table from
which their supper had been eaten, Mrs. Gaston
seated herself by the already nearly half burned
penny candle, whose dim light scarcely enabled
her failing eyesight to discern the edges of the
dark cloth upon which she was working, and
composed herself to her task. Hour after hour
she toiled on, weary and aching in every limb.
But she remitted not her labors until long after
midnight, and then not until her last candle
had burned away to the socket in which it rested.
Then she put aside her work with a sigh, as she
reflected upon the slow progress she had made,
and, disrobing herself, laid her over-wearied
body beside that of her sick child. Ella was
asleep; but her breathing was hard, and her
mother perceived, upon laying her hand upon
her face, that her fever had greatly increased.
But she knew no means of alleviation, and
therefore did not attempt any. In a little while,
nature claimed for her a respite. Sleep locked
her senses in forgetfulness.</p>

<p>It may interest some of our readers to know
how this ingenious invention is applied to such
various purposes of utility. The following brief
account will explain the mode of operation:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sewing-machine, of which a representation
is now given, is about twelve inches square,
and is driven by a wheel at the end of a main shaft
which passes through the machine. The wheel
can be driven either by the hand, foot, or steam-engine.
From the top plate of the machine and
at the side on which the wheel is placed, an arm
rises to about ten inches and extends to the opposite
or front side, in which arm is worked a
lever which drives the vertical needle. This
needle is attached to a sliding bar, worked by
the arm. Underneath and below the plate of
the machine is another needle of horizontal
shape, which is fed by a bobbin or reel of thread
also out of sight. Imagine the vertical needle
as being threaded and supplied by a reel on the
top of the arm, and the horizontal needle threaded
as described, and the machine put in motion;
the vertical needle would penetrate the cloth or
other material, say half an inch below the surface,
and, on being drawn back by the action of
the machine, would leave a loop; when this
loop is formed, and at the exact time, the horizontal
needle enters it and holds the thread until
the stitch is formed, when by a counter action
it revolves back and throws the loop off and
takes another. The machine is capable of stitching
every part of any garment, except the buttons
and button-holes, whether the work be
<em>light</em> or <em>heavy</em>, <em>coarse</em> or <em>fine</em>; also for gaiters,
boots, shoes, sacks, bags, sailcloths, tents, &amp;c.
&amp;c. It is so <em>simple</em> in its construction and action
that it may be worked by a <em>child</em>, and will sew
a circle, curve, or turn a square corner, equally
as well as a straight line. It is only twelve
inches square, and is driven by the hand or foot.
By the action of a screen in the machine, the
stitch can be either lengthened or shortened, as
may be desired. The machine feeds itself with
both cloth and thread, and it is only necessary
for the operator to guide the material to the
needle to sew. It will with ease sew a yard per
minute, stronger, more uniform, and consequently
better than it is possible to be done by
hand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SHOWING HOW KITTY FARED (OR SCARCELY
FARED AT ALL) THE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL,
AND THE DREADFUL DISASTER THAT BEFELL
HER.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh! my dear Nelly, I'm in such a mess, and
can't think how I am to get out of it. I would
run away, only I don't know where to run to:
and, besides, all the doors are fast; and more
than that, I feel ma would only bring me back
again if I were to get away. Only think of that
shabby Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; (you know whom I mean) opening
all the letters; and I never knew this until
my letter was in her bag. Mrs. Sharpe (who has
promised to give this to some one who will drop
it in the post on the sly for me) says every word
we write home, and every word we receive from
home, is pried into, and very often kept back
if it does not exactly please the Lady Principal!
A pretty lady! I wonder she isn't ashamed of
herself! A nice example to set us young girls&mdash;actually
teaching as to go a peeping into other
persons' secrets! Meggy (that's Miss Sharpe's
name) says she intends speaking to her papa
about it. He is a Scotch lawyer; and she has
often heard him say that there's a fine of 100<em>l.</em>
for any one who breaks a seal upon trust papers!
What fun it would be if we could make the Lady
Principal pay 100<em>l.</em>! I'm sure it would only serve
her right.</p>

<p>The beauty of it is, Nelly, she says she only
looks at the signatures of the letters that come
here, to see if they are from proper persons.
This is very likely! How, then, <em>does she know
all that is going on in the girls' homes, if she never
reads their letters</em>? I've no patience with her!
I'm sure that I shall never be able to look the
mean creature in the face again.</p>

<p>Now, Nelly, I must tell you all about the young
ladies; for I may not have another opportunity,
dearest, of smuggling out a letter.</p>

<p>Well, then, when we went to breakfast, Mrs.
Rodwell was seated on a sort of raised throne at
the end of the table, and all the girls walked
up to her to courtesy, and "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">souhaiter le bon jour,
Madame</i>," and show her&mdash;this is a positive fact,
dearest&mdash;their teeth and nails! Meggy told me
this was to teach us to keep them sharp and in
good fighting condition, as <em>woman's natural weapons</em>;
but she was only laughing at me, for I
learnt afterwards it was to see that they were
properly cleaned every morning. But I think
the practice might well be dispensed with, as not
being over and above complimentary to young
ladies!</p>

<p>When my turn came, I was preparing to show
my teeth in real earnest&mdash;for I felt both indignant
and ashamed of such treatment&mdash;when she took
me kindly by the hand, and instantly, at that touch
of kindness, my mouth shut of its own accord.
She asked me how I had slept, and introduced
me to Miss Plodder, who, she said would cheer
my spirits and make me feel more at home. She
is such a fat, round, little sleepy, and looks as
stupid, too, as she is fat! If my spirits have to
wait for Miss Plodder to cheer them, I'm afraid
they'll have to wait long enough.</p>

<p>Well, my own darling Nell knows I am not
dainty, and that I should think it wicked to be
fanciful over good food; but I never did see such
thick slices of bread, smeared over with what
they called butter. I have not been so petted at
home as to quarrel at any time with my bread
and butter; but, on my word, I should as soon
have thought of munching a deal board, as taking
up one of the long slices&mdash;planks, rather&mdash;that
were piled up, as in a timber yard, before me;
and yet, to see the poor hungry girls! If it had
been wedding-cake, they could not have devoured
it more greedily!</p>

<p>I thought of the dear delicious hot rolls, soaked
through and through with the best Fresh (at
sixteen pence a pound) that I had been in the
habit of having every morning for breakfast, and
sighed that I was not at home.</p>

<p>Meggy asked me which I liked best, "<em>hay or
beans?</em>" Before I could answer that I had never
tasted either, the Lady Principal inquired "if I
took cocoa or coffee?" A basin of the latter
was brought to me, but unless I had been told it
was coffee, I'm sure I should never have guessed
it. It looked more like water taken from the
Regent's-canal. Meggy whispered into my ear,
"Hay's best;" and seeing me puzzled, she ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>plained,
shortly afterwards, that, in their school
dictionary, hay meant cocoa, and that beans was
the English for coffee, from a popular belief,
which she said "was extremely well grounded"
(in their coffee cups), that "those agricultural
commodities formed the principal ingredients of
their matutinal beverages."</p>

<p>Meggy Sharpe is such a nice girl, so clever, and
so full of fun, and such large bright, black eyes,
and a face laughing all over with mischief, it
puts one in good-humor merely to look at it. I
feel I shall love her very much, but not so much
as you, dearest Nelly.</p>

<p>After breakfast, she told Miss Plodder that she
would "take care of me, and introduce me to
the Elders." Then bidding me not to be afraid,
she led me by the hand to a group of tall young
ladies, and in a set speech, delivered in a mock
tone, such as I've heard my brothers imitate
Mr. John Cooper in, "begged to present a humble
candidate to their friendship and favor." The
tallest, a Miss Noble, who seemed the head girl,
and as stiff as a backboard, made me welcome,
and then began questioning me in the following
manner: "Did I live in London?&mdash;at the Westend,
of course?&mdash;perhaps in Belgrave-square?
No! then near Hyde Park? No! then in one of
the squares? Yes! Well, some of the squares
were still respectable. In which of the squares
did I live, pray?"</p>

<p>I mumbled out, as well as I could, "Torrington-square."</p>

<p>"Oh! hem! where was Torrington-square?"
continued my tormentor. "Near the city, was
it not? No!&mdash;what, near Russell-square and
Gower-street? Gower-street! Well, really, she
knew nothing of those parts of the town."</p>

<p>I was next asked, "Whether my mamma went
to court?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, in my ignorance; "but
papa does sometimes, and takes his blue bag with
him when he has law business." This gave
rise to shouts of laughter, and long exclamations
of "Dear, dear!" whilst looks of pity were
showered down upon me.</p>

<p>"I mean," continued Miss Noble, "her Majesty's
receptions. My mamma goes to court;
and I am to be presented myself by the Grand
Duchess of Mechlenburgh-Sedlitz immediately
on my leaving college;" and she tossed her head
up to the ceiling, until I thought it would never
come down again.</p>

<p>"How did you come last night?" resumed
Miss Noble. "In the omnibus," cried out
wicked Meggy, who immediately ran away.</p>

<p>"No; I know how she came," said another
beauty, "for I was in the drawing-room at the
time, and looked out of the window; she came
in a clarence <em>with one horse</em>." And they all
tittered again, and I felt my cheeks growing red,
though why I should be ashamed of mamma's
pretty clarence I don't know, even though it has
but <em>one</em> horse.</p>

<p>I was next asked, "Whether my paternal
(meaning papa, I suppose) lived at home?"
"Of course," I answered; "where should he
live?" "Why some people have an establishment
in the city, and a family in a square. The
shop (and they tittered again) must not be neglected."
"Do not be rude, Miss Ogle," interrupted
Miss Noble, affecting to be very serious;
"personalities are extremely rude; and, besides,
Miss Clover's father may not live in a shop.
Tell us, dear, what profession are you in?" "I&mdash;I'm
in no profession," I said, trembling lest I
should be laughed at again. "Dear! what beautiful
simplicity!" said the court lady, lifting her
hands up; "not you&mdash;your father, child." "Oh!
papa is a stockbroker." "A what? A stockbroker!
Pray, what's that?" "I know," said
the young lady who had told about the clarence
with one horse; "it's a trade; for I hear papa
talk of desiring his stockbroker to buy and sell;
and I am certain, now I think of it, that they
deal in <em>bears and ducks</em>." "No such thing,"
exclaimed a little girl with a turn-up nose; "they
sell old stocks, such as bankrupts' stocks, or retiring
haberdashers' stocks; they're a sort of
old-clothesmen." "At any rate, they are not
professional, and therefore must be in trade,"
decided proud Miss Noble; and they all turned
away from me, with sneers and contempt. "It's
no such thing," I burst out; "my papa is a
gentleman&mdash;a real gentleman&mdash;and he's quite as
good, if not better, than any of your papas,
though you are so proud; and I sha'n't answer
any more of your rude questions." "That's
right," laughed Meggy; "that's the way to disappoint
them. Don't tell 'em anything."</p>

<p>You should have heard, too, Nelly, their curiosity
about my brothers, making me describe
them over and over again&mdash;their eyes, whiskers,
noses, and calling them by their names, Oscar,
Alfred, Augustus, Henry, as if they had known
them for years. The impudent girl, with the
turn-up nose, actually said she felt she could
madly love Oscar; and I couldn't help replying,
"You need not trouble yourself, Miss; he'll
never ask you." Silly thing! I'm sure Oscar
wouldn't as much as look at her&mdash;not even in
church.</p>

<p>But the greatest shame has yet to come. You
can never believe what I am going to tell you,
Nelly, although you know I scorn fibbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Class had just broken up, when a maid came
in carrying a large tray; and only imagine my
confusion when I saw laid out on it all my cakes
and goodies! Miss Bright (the quiet teacher who
had brought me into the schoolroom) called me,
and I was going to ask for permission to put
them into my play-trunk, when&mdash;think of my
surprise, Nelly!&mdash;if she did not actually seize
<em>my plum-cake, and begin cutting it up into thin
slices</em>! At first I was so shocked that I could
not speak; and I was about to stop her, when she
cut some large slices, and desired me "to hand
them to the governesses, and then take the dish
round to each young lady." I am afraid I looked
vexed, and, in truth, I was nearly choking with
passion; and I am sure you would have done
the same, Nelly, for you would have seen no
joke in treating girls to your goodies, after they
had been making fun of you, and turning your
papa and mamma into ridicule. But this was
not all; for one rude thing, upon ascertaining
from me that mamma made it, said, in a voice
running over with vinegar, "I thought so, for
she has forgotten the plums." Then my oranges
were cut into quarters, and I had to hand them
round also (<em>the governesses had halves!</em>) until
all was gone, and I had only two pieces myself
as a favor. Now, don't think me greedy, Nelly&mdash;you
know I don't care for feasting, only I do
not like to be forced to be generous, and to give
to all alike, whether I like them or not&mdash;offering
as much to that proud Miss Noble (who is not
too proud, however, to eat another girl's cake)
as to dear Meggy. I dare say it is very pleasant
when it's not your own&mdash;"share and share
alike" is all very fine; but I should like to know
when their goodies are coming? As I am the
last girl entering this term, I suppose it won't be
before next half-year? And I mean to say,
Nelly, it is most heart-rending&mdash;putting insult
on the top of cruelty&mdash;to force you to help the
governesses, and to <em>double shares, too</em>, whilst I'm
sure my slice broke all to pieces, it was so miserably
thin.</p>

<p>Oh, dear, there's Mrs. Rodwell. If she catches
me writing, I shall be found out; so, my own
darling Nelly, I must say good-by. Mind you
write soon, and tell me all about dear S. Has
he asked after me? and often? Is he pale?
Tell him not to forget your devoted, true-hearted</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Kitty Clover</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>P. S.&mdash;Oh! Nelly, I have had such a fright;
my heart is jumping up and down like a canary
in a cage when the cat's underneath it. Only
think of the Lady Principal's coming up to my
desk. I made sure it was to ask me for this
letter, and I determined in my mind to swallow
it sooner than let her read it. But, thank goodness!
it was only to say she had not opened my
last letter to you, as it was sealed; but, for the
future, she would close them herself, after looking
over their contents. Much obliged! Catch
me giving her any other than my own compositions.
So, darling, we are safe; but isn't that
lucky?</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I'm sure you'll never be able to read
this scrawl. Why didn't you answer my last?</p>

<h2><a name="ANECDOTE_OF_BYRON" id="ANECDOTE_OF_BYRON"></a>ANECDOTE OF BYRON.</h2>


<p>"I heard an anecdote that evening of the poet,
which was very characteristic, and quite new to
me. When at Pisa, his lordship found it difficult
to keep up his practice with the pistol on account
of the objections of his neighbors and the municipal
regulations of the place. He, therefore,
by the aid of a small gratuity, obtained permission
from a farmer in the vicinity to shoot at a
mark in his paddock. On the occasion of his
first visit to the premises, the peasant's daughter,
a very pretty <em>contadina</em>, accosted the bard
after the genial manner of her country. She
wore in her bosom a freshly-plucked rose with
two buds attached to the stein. Byron sportively
asked her to give him the flower. She hesitated,
and blushed. He instantly turned to his
companion and rehearsed in English a very
natural tale of humble and virtuous love, bitterly
contrasting the apparent loyalty of this fair rustic
with women in high life. Then, with perfect
seriousness, he again asked for the rose as
a token of sympathy for an unloved exile. His
manner and words moved the girl to tears. She
handed him the rose with a look of compassion,
and silently withdrew. The incident aroused
his latent superstition. He was lost in a reverie
for several minutes, and then inquired of his
friend if he remembered that Rousseau confessed
throwing stones at a tree to test the prospects of
his future happiness. The flower was devoted
to a similar ordeal. It was carefully attached
to an adjacent pale, and Byron having withdrawn
several paces, declared his intention of
severing one of the buds from the stalk at one
fire. He looked very carefully to his priming,
and aimed with great firmness and deliberation.
The ball cut the bud neatly off, and just grazed
the leaves of the rose. A bright smile illumined
the poet's countenance, and he rode back
to Pisa in a flow of spirits."</p>

<p>ORION.&mdash;Whoever learns this constellation
can never forget the brilliant lesson. It is too
clearly defined and magnificently beautiful to
pass from the memory. It is distinguished by
four bright stars, which form a parallelogram:
Betelguese, a star of great brilliancy, and of the
first magnitude, in the right shoulder, Bellatrix
in the left, 7&frac12;° east of Betelguese, are called the
"epaulets of Orion." Rigel, a star of the first
magnitude, marks the left foot, and is 15° south
of Bellatrix. Eight and a half degrees east of
Rigel is Saiph, forming the lower end of the
parallelogram.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i9a">"First in rank</div>
  <div class="i0">The martial star upon his shoulder flames:</div>
  <div class="i0">A rival star illuminates his foot;</div>
  <div class="i0">And on his girdle beams a luminary</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, in the vicinity of other stars,</div>
  <div class="i0">Might claim the proudest honors."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Three bright stars lie in a straight line near
the middle of the square, and are known by the
name of the "Three Kings," or the "Ell," or
"Yard." In sacred history, they are usually
termed the "bands of Orion;" they are also
known as the "belt" of Orion. The space they
occupy is three degrees, and a straight line passing
through them, points to the Pleiades on one
side and Sirius on the other. There is a row
of small stars running down obliquely from the
belt, called the "sword of Orion." In the middle
of this row is one of the most remarkable
nebulæ in the heavens. With a good telescope,
in the centre an apparent opening is discovered,
through which, as through a window, we seem
to get a glimpse of other heavens and brighter
regions beyond. How little man appears, with
all his pride of pomp and splendor, in contemplating
this immeasurable expanse, and with awe
we are led to exclaim, "What is man, that <em>Thou</em>
art mindful of him?"</p>

<p>About 9° west of Bellatrix are eight stars of
the fourth magnitude, in a curved line that marks
the lion's skin, which Orion used as a shield in
his left hand. Rheita asserts there are 2,000 stars
in this constellation, although but 78 are visible
to the naked eye. Galileo found 80 in the belt,
21 in a nebulous star in the head, and about 500
in another part within the space of four degrees.
This constellation comes to the meridian the
21st of January.</p>

<p>According to some Greek authorities, Orion
was a son of Neptune and Euryale, a famous
Amazonian huntress, and inheriting the disposition
of his mother, became the most famous
hunter in the world, and boasted that there was
not an animal on earth which he could not conquer.
To punish this vanity, a scorpion sprang
out of the earth and bit him, so that he died of
the poison, and, at the request of Diana, he was
placed among the stars opposite the scorpion
that caused his death. Others say that he was
the gift of the gods to a peasant of B&oelig;otia as a
reward for piety, and that he far surpassed other
mortals in strength and stature.</p>

<p>LEPUS&mdash;<em>The Hare.</em>&mdash;This constellation is
situated south of Orion, and comes to the meridian
on the 24th of January. It may readily
be distinguished by means of four stars of the
third magnitude, which form an irregular square
or trapezium. Three small stars curve along
the back, while four minute ones mark the ears,
and are 5° south of Rigel, whose brilliancy obscures
their lesser light. The Greeks assert this
animal was one which Orion delighted in hunting,
therefore it was placed near him in the sky.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>COLUMBIA&mdash;<em>Noah's Dove.</em>&mdash;Continuing a
straight line from the Hare 16° south, it comes
to Phaet, a star of the second magnitude, in the
Dove. This star is also on the meridian at the
same time with that in the belt of Orion, and with
Sirius and Naos makes an equilateral triangle.
This constellation is so called in commemoration
of the dove Noah sent out "to see if the
waters were abated from off the face of the
ground," after the ark had rested on Ararat.
"And the dove came in to him, in the evening, and
lo! in her mouth was an olive leaf!"</p>

<p>ERIDANUS.&mdash;This constellation is composed
of 84 stars, of which one is of the first magnitude,
one of the second, and eleven of the
third. The others are very minute stars, and
the constellation is exceedingly difficult to trace
in the heavens. Achernar is a star of great brilliancy
and beauty, but it cannot be seen in our
latitude, having a southern declination of 58°.
West of Rigel are four stars of the fourth magnitude,
and five of the fifth, arching up in a
semicircular form, marking the first bend of the
northern stream, while 19° west of Rigel glitters
a bright star of the second magnitude, called
Gamma. This star is on the meridian thirteen
minutes after the Pleiades. The entire length
of Eridanus is 130°, and as the other stars which
compose it are very minute, it is not desirable
to trace them.</p>

<p>The Latin poets have rendered this river (which
is in Cisalpine Gaul, and also called Padus, and by
moderns, Po) memorable by its connection with
the beautiful fable of Phaeton, a favorite of
Venus, who intrusted him with the care of one
of her temples. Vain of the favor of the goddess,
he obtained an oath from his father,
Ph&oelig;bus, that he would grant him any request
he should make. The charioteer of the skies
had no sooner uttered the oath than</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">

  <div class="i0">"The youth, transported, asks without delay,</div>
  <div class="i0">To guide the Sun's bright chariot for a day;</div>
  <div class="i0">The god repented of the oath he took,</div>
  <div class="i0">For anguish thrice his radiant head he shook;</div>
  <div class="i0">'My son,' says he, 'some other proof require&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">That hurls the three-forked thunder from above,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dares try his strength; yet who as strong as Jove?</div>
  <div class="i0">Besides, consider what impetuous force</div>

  <div class="i0">But how could you resist the orbs that roll</div>
  <div class="i0">In adverse whirls, and stem the rapid pole!'"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ph&oelig;bus pleaded with his son in vain. Phaeton
undertook the aerial journey, and no sooner had
he received the reins than he forgot the explicit
directions of his father, and betrayed his ignorance
of the manner of guiding the chariot. The
flying coursers became sensible of the confusion
of their driver, and immediately departed from
the usual track. Too late Phaeton saw his rashness,
and already heaven and earth were threatened
with destruction as the penalty, when
Jupiter, perceiving the disorder of the horses,
struck the driver with a thunderbolt, and he fell
headlong into the river Eridanus&mdash;</p>

<p>In Ethiopian and Libyan mythology, it is
asserted that the great heat produced by the sun's
deviation from his usual course dried up the
blood of the Ethiopians, and turned their skins
black, and produced sterility and barrenness
over the greater part of Libya. Evidently this
fable alludes to some extraordinary heats at a
remote period, and of which this confused tradition
is all the account that has descended to
later times.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>CAMELOPARDALUS.&mdash;This constellation
is of modern origin, and the stars&mdash;the largest
being of the fourth magnitude&mdash;are too unimportant
and scattered to invite attention. It occupies
the space between the head of the Lynx and the
pole, containing 58 minute stars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>AURIGA.&mdash;This brilliant constellation is
readily distinguished by the most beautiful star
which lies between Orion and the polar star.
This star is called Capella, and marks the position
of the Goat, as well as the heart of Auriga,
and with Menkalina in the right shoulder, and
Auriga or El Nath in the right foot, which also
forms the top of the northern horn of the Bull,
forms a beautiful triangle. Capella and Menkalina
in the shoulders, have the same distance
between them, and are of the same size
and brilliancy as Betelguese and Bellatrix in
Orion, being 7&frac12;° apart, and the four form a long,
narrow parallelogram, lying north and south,
and it is a curious coincidence that its length is
precisely five times its breadth. Auriga, Capella,
and Menkalina, together with a star of
the fourth magnitude in the head, marked Delta,
make an elongated diamond. There can be no
more exciting, rational, or pleasant pastime than
that of forming different objects by various arrangements
of the stars. Select any portion of
the heavens, and squares, angles, curves, crosses,
and diamonds are visible, and no shape can
hardly be conceived that its counterpart might
not be traced in the starry firmament above.
Those who have never spent an hour thus pleasantly
employed, are not aware of the pleasure
to be found in contemplating the "stars, which
are the poetry of heaven."</p>

<p>Mythology is at fault as to the origin of this

<p>GEMINI.&mdash;This constellation is remarkable
from the singularity of one of its most brilliant
stars, Castor, which, on looking through a telescope,
resolves into two distinct stars, one of
which is very small, and revolves around the
larger one once in a period of 342 years and two
months. Four and a half degrees south-west of
Castor may be seen Pollux, a star of equal brilliancy.
This constellation comes to its meridian
the 24th of February. It takes its rise from
Castor and Pollux, sons of Jupiter and Leda,
Queen of Sparta, who were translated to a place
in the heavens by Jupiter, as a reward for their
courage and bravery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>CANIS MINOR.&mdash;This is a small constellation,
containing only fourteen stars, of which
two are of great brilliancy. Procyon, a star of
the first magnitude, is situated twenty-three degrees
south of Pollux, and twenty-six degrees
east of Betelguese, and forms with them a large
right-angled triangle. Procyon comes to the
meridian the 24th of February. According to
Greek mythology, this is one of Orion's hounds.
The Egyptians, however, claim its origin from
their god Anubis, whom they worshipped under
the form of a dog's head. Probably the Egyptians
were the inventors of the idea, as the constellation
rises a little before Sirius, which, at a
particular season, they always dreaded; therefore
they represented it as a watchful creature,
that warned them of the approach of danger.
Moderns have asserted it to be one of Actæon's
hounds, that devoured their master after he had
been transformed into a stag by Diana, to prevent
his betraying her. This is evidently an
error, as there is no proof to sustain it.</p>

<p>CANIS MAJOR.&mdash;This interesting constellation
is situated south-east of Orion, and is universally
known by the brilliancy of its principal
star, Sirius, which is the largest and brightest in
the heavens. In our hemisphere, during the
winter months, it glows with a lustre unequalled
by any other star in the firmament. It is also
the nearest star to the earth, yet the distance between
Sirius and us is so great that sound, travelling
thirteen miles a minute, would be three
millions of years in traversing the mighty space.
And a ray of light, which moves at the rate of
200,000 miles per second, would be three years
and eighty-two days in passing through the vast
space that lies between Sirius and the earth.
If the nearest star to the earth gives such results,
what must those give situated a thousand
times as far beyond, where worlds, surrounded
by their satellites, roll in their orbits away in
the immensity of space, each revolving around
its own sun, while, millions of miles beyond,
stars, like our own, greet their visual organs,
and inspire as great an interest to the inhabitants
of that world as those do to us which we discover
by the aid of our powerful telescopes?</p>

<p>The Thebans determine the length of the year
by Sirius, and the Egyptians dreaded its approach,
as, at its rising, commenced the inundation of
the Nile, teeming with malaria and death.</p>

<h2><a name="INGENUITY_OF_BEES" id="INGENUITY_OF_BEES"></a>INGENUITY OF BEES.</h2>


<p>The wonderful ingenuity of bees has often
been remarked. The rose-cutter separates circular
pieces from leaves with precision, and, digging
a hole six or eight inches deep in the ground,
the bee rolls up the leaf, and depositing it in the
hole, lodges and secures an egg in it, with food
for the larva when hatched, and often several,
but all separated, and very perfect, and the bee
then presides in the upper part to protect her
brood. The upholsterer makes a hole enlarged
at the bottom, and lines the whole with red
poppy leaves, lays her eggs, supplies them with
food, &amp;c., separately, then turns down the lining
to cover them, and closing the hole, leaves them
to nature. The wood-piercer makes a perpendicular
hole with vast labor in a decaying tree,
in the sunshine, a foot deep; then deposits her
eggs and food, and separates each by a dwarf
wall made of sawdust and gluten, each higher
than the other, and the last closing the hole;
and she then makes another hole horizontally, to
enable them to escape as they successively mature.
The mason-bee constructs a nest on the
side of a sunny wall, makes up sand pellets with
gluten, and by persevering industry fixes and
finishes a cell, in which it lays an egg and provisions.
It then forms others beside it, and covers
in the whole, the structure being as firm as the
stone. Wasps and humble-bees make cavities in
banks. They line them with wax, and make
innumerable cells for their eggs in perfect communities.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GRAND ENTRANCE TO THE PALACE OF KONYUNJIK.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_134big.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>Mr. Layard, having a small amount of money
at his disposal, proceeded to make excavations
at Konyunjik, opposite Mosul, where the
first Assyrian Sculptures had been found. In a
month, nine chambers had been explored. The
palace had been destroyed by fire. The alabaster
slabs were almost reduced to lime, and many
of them fell to pieces as soon as uncovered. In
its architecture, the newly-discovered edifice resembled
the palaces of Nimroud and Khorsobad.
The chambers were long and narrow. The walls
were of unbaked bricks, with a panelling of
sculptured slabs. The bas-reliefs were greatly
inferior in general design, and in the beauty of
the details, to those of the earliest palace of
Nimroud.</p>

<p>The funds assigned to the Trustees of the British
Museum for the excavations in Assyria had
now been expended by Mr. Layard. He had
every reason to congratulate himself upon the
results of his labors. Scarcely a year before,
with the exception of the ruins of Khorsobad,
not one Assyrian monument was known. Almost
sufficient materials had now been obtained
to restore much of the lost history of the country,
and to confirm the vague traditions of the
learning and civilization of its people, hitherto
considered fabulous. The monuments had been
carefully preserved, and the inscriptions in the
cuneiform character copied entire. Bidding his
workmen an affectionate farewell, and receiving
their best wishes for his future prosperity, Mr.
Layard left the ancient Assyria for England.</p>

<p>Our explorer was not allowed to remain inactive
long. After a few months' residence in
England, during the year 1848, to recruit his
constitution, he received orders to proceed to his
post of Her Majesty's Embassy in Turkey. Soon
afterwards, his work, "Nineveh and its Remains,"
was published; and so intense was the
interest excited, that the Trustees of the British
Museum requested him to undertake the superintendence
of a second expedition into Assyria.
Mr. Layard cheerfully consented, and immediately
formed a plan of operations. Mr. H.
Cooper, a competent artist, was appointed to accompany
the expedition, and several Arabs, who
had been found able and faithful, were secured
by Mr. Layard. Such was the size of the party
formed, that it was deemed necessary to journey
in a caravan to Mosul. On the way, Mr. Layard,
ever observing and curious, traced the line
of the celebrated retreat of Xenophon and his
ten thousand Greeks.</p>

<p>The very day after his arrival at Mosul, Mr.
Layard visited the mound of Konyunjik. The
earth had accumulated above the ruins to a considerable
depth; and, to save the labor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
clearing it all away, the workmen constructed
tunnels. Twelve or fourteen parties of laborers
were organized by Mr. Layard, and all worked
under his superintendence. Operations were
carried on at the same time at the great mound
of Nimroud. Within two months, several magnificent
chambers were excavated at Konyunjik.
Assyrian conquests were represented upon the
bas-reliefs, each chamber being devoted to one
conquering expedition. Thus each was, so to
speak, a new volume of history. An understanding
of the copious inscriptions in cuneiform
character was all that was necessary to the
perusal; and, thanks to the exertions of Rawlinson,
Hincks, and other scholars, this character
was now readable to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>The Assyrian mode of building was fully illustrated
on the bas-reliefs. From them, Mr. Layard
found that the Assyrians were well acquainted
with the lever and the roller, and also with
the art of twisting thick ropes. The men employed
in building were known to be captives
by their wearing chains, and being urged on by
masters armed with staves. A king was represented
as superintending the erection of the edifice,
and Mr. Layard says that there can be but
little doubt that it was intended for Sennacherib,
whom the inscriptions mention as the builder of
the great palace of Nineveh, and as a mighty
conqueror.</p>

<p>The discovery of the grand entrance to the
palace of Konyunjik was an important result of
Mr. Layard's labors. It was a façade on the
south-east side of the edifice. Ten colossal bulls,
with six human figures of gigantic proportions,
were here grouped together, and the length of
the whole, without including the sculptured
walls continued beyond the smaller entrances,
was estimated at one hundred and eighty feet.
Among the figures that adorned this grand entrance
was seen the Assyrian Hercules, strangling
a lion. The legs, feet, and drapery of the
god were in the boldest relief, and designed with
truth and vigor.</p>

<p>On the slabs in one of the chambers of this
palace was represented the siege and capture of
Lachish, or Lakhisha, a Jewish city, which, as
we know from Scripture, was taken by Sennacherib.
The whole power of the king seemed
to have been called forth to take this stronghold.
All the operations of the besiegers were represented.
Before the gate of the city was Sennacherib,
seated on a gorgeous throne, giving orders
for the slaughter of the citizens. The chiefs of
conquered tribes were represented as crouching
at the foot of the throne. At the head of the
king was an inscription, which Dr. Hincks thus
translates: "Sennacherib, the mighty king,
king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the
throne of judgment, before (or at the entrance
of) the city of Lachish (Lakhisha). I give permission
for its slaughter." This furnishes a
very important illustration of the Bible.</p>

</div>

<p>In a chamber, in the south-west corner of the
same palace, was found a large number of finely
engraved seals, and among them was one&mdash;believed
to be the royal signet&mdash;having engraved
upon it a king plunging a dagger into a rampant
lion. Egyptian and Ph&oelig;nician seals were also
discovered in the same apartment. One of the
Egyptian seals has been discovered to be that of
Sabaco, who reigned in Egypt at the end of the
seventh century before Christ, the exact time at
which Sennacherib came to the throne. The
signets of the two kings were most probably attached
to a treaty. Iron picks and saws, a large
number of bronze articles, pearl and ivory ornaments,
part of an ivory staff, believed to have
been a sceptre, and many other curious remains
of ancient art, were discovered in the various
chambers of this gorgeous palace.</p>

<p>During the removal of some sculptures, Mr.
Layard had an opportunity of visiting some remarkable
remains near the village of Bavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>.
They were bas-reliefs, cut in the rock, representing
warlike events. One of the tablets contained
a horseman at full speed, and the remains
of other figures. Both horse and rider were of
colossal proportions, and wonderful for their
spirit and outline. The warrior, who wore the
Assyrian armor, was in the act of charging the
enemy. Before him was a colossal figure of the
king, and behind him a deity with a horned cap.
Above his head was a row of smaller figures of
gods standing on animals of various forms. The
inscriptions upon these rock-sculptures show
that they were designed to commemorate the
triumphant return of Sennacherib from his expedition
against Babylon. Beneath the sculptured
tablets, and in the bed of the Gomel, were
seen two enormous fragments of rock, which
appeared to have been torn from the overhanging
cliff. They still bore the remains of ancient
sculpture. On them was represented the Assyrian
Hercules strangling the lion, between two
winged, human-headed bulls, back to back, as at
the grand entrances of the palaces of Konyunjik
and Khorsobad. Above this group was the king,
worshipping between two deities, who stood on
mythic animals, having the heads of eagles, the
bodies and forefeet of lions, and hind legs armed
with the talons of a bird of prey.</p>

<p>Remains and foundations of buildings in well-hewn
stones were discovered under the thick
mud deposited by the Gomel when swollen by
rains. A series of basins cut in the rock, and
descending in steps to the stream, were discovered
by excavation. The water had originally
been led from one to the other by small conduits,
the lowest of which was ornamented at its mouth
by two rampant lions in relief. Mr. Layard restored
this fountain as it had been in the time
of the Assyrians. From the nature and number
of the monuments at Bavian, the explorer inferred
that it had been a sacred spot, devoted to
religious ceremonies and national sacrifices. The
remains of a causeway, from Nineveh to Bavian,
were traced upon the plain.</p>

<h2><a name="A_STORY_OF_VALENTINES_DAY" id="A_STORY_OF_VALENTINES_DAY"></a>A STORY OF VALENTINE'S DAY.</h2>

<p class="p8">BY MRS. ABDY.</p>


<p>Two young girls were seated in the drawing-room
of a handsome house in the neighborhood
of Belgrave Square, engaged in earnest conversation.
Of them it might truly be said, in the
words of Lord Byron, that</p>

<p class="center">"Both were young, and one was beautiful."</p>

<p>Nature had been a lavish benefactress to the
one, and a churlish niggard to the other; and
Fortune had followed in her sister's wake, and
shown just as great an amount of partiality in
the distribution of her favors. Philippa Roxby
and Janet Penson were the wards of Mr. Chetwode,
a good-natured, warm-hearted man, who,
having no wife, child, or sister of his own, was
expected by the little world of his acquaintance
to take unlimited interest in the wives, children,
and sisters of other people, and to perform unlimited
services in their behalf. About a year
had elapsed since the death of two of his friends
within a few weeks of each other; the wealthy
widower, Mr. Roxby, and the narrowly-jointured
widow, Mrs. Penson, conferred on him the
somewhat startling responsibility of becoming
guardian to two girls of the respective ages of
eighteen and nineteen.</p>

<p>Philippa Roxby was "a lass wi' golden dower
and golden hair," beautiful enough to inspire a
poet or painter, and rich enough to satisfy the
calculations of the most scheming of heiress-hunters.
Janet Penson was remarkably plain;
in fact, it would have been somewhat difficult, in
this age of bright eyes, luxuriant tresses, and
graceful forms, to find any one so, thoroughly
destitute of attraction. Her features were irregular;
her pale cheek and heavy eye indicated
the want of that health which, when combined
with youth and cheerfulness, may be said to offer
a tolerable substitute for beauty; and worse than
all, Janet was palpably deformed, beyond the
power of Amesbury to remedy, or of Mrs. Geary
to conceal. Perhaps some of my readers will
think that the worst still remains to be told,
when I add that Janet's fortune was very small;
two-thirds of the income of Mrs. Penson expired
with her, and a hundred a year was all that remained
for the provision of the orphan. Mr.
Chetwode, however, was as kind and feeling a
man as the most enthusiastic of his friends believed
him to be. He made no distinction in his
manner between the lovely heiress and her less
fortunate companion; the comforts of his house,
his carriage, his attentive servants, his pleasant
circle of visitors, extended alike to each; but
how different were their thoughts and feelings!
The one looked at society through a Claude
Lorraine glass, the other through a screen of
dark crape. Janet, although all immediately
connected with her were kind and considerate,
had often the trial of encountering, in mixed
company, the look of ridicule and the whisper
of scorn; she pined for the fond and dear mother
by whom she was so tenderly beloved, notwithstanding
her personal deficiencies; nor could
she, like most young women, suffering under a
similar loss, anticipate the time when she should
become the object of a still more precious and
valuable love; she felt, bitterly felt, that the
delight of a calm home, the language of loving
eyes, the homage of a true heart&mdash;all must be
ever withheld from her; and could she only
have possessed "the fortune of a face," there
was no possible amount of poverty and hardship
which she would not have gladly welcomed as
its accompaniment. She was, however, agreeably
surprised in the character and manners of her
constant associate, Philippa Roxby; she had
pictured her as scornful and repelling, and found
her unassuming and kind-hearted. I am of
opinion that people in general treat heiresses
with a great deal of injustice; dramatists and
novelists are especially fond of showing them
up in an unamiable light; but, so far as my
knowledge of them goes, it is greatly in their
favor. Philippa Roxby (and I am disposed to
think she was a tolerably fair specimen of the
generality of heiresses) was pleasing and unaffected
in her manners, and remarkably simple
in her tastes. Accustomed from childhood to an
elegantly supplied table, she felt an indifference
to luxuries which can never be known by those
who manufacture their dainties with their own
hands, and pay for them from their own scanty
purses; she had never been obliged to economize
in dress, therefore did not, like many young
persons, live in a world of shreds and patches,
and pant with perpetual eagerness to unravel
the ever-recurring mystery of the "last new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fashion;" all such matters she wisely left to
Fashion's high priestess, the milliner. She
drew, sang, and played well, and perfectly understood
French, Italian, and German: but these
acquirements inspired her with no vanity; she
felt that, having had from an early age the most
accomplished of governesses, and the best of
masters, it would have been very inexcusable if
she had not profited by their instructions.</p>

<p>Praise be to the first pastrycook who discovered
the important fact that giving novices the unlimited
range of the tarts and cakes for a few
days is the certain way to insure their subsequent
temperance! Philippa had enjoyed the sugarplums
and confections of society without restriction,
and rated them at their real value. When
first introduced to Janet, she felt considerably
disappointed; she had hoped (for she was incapable
of envy) that her companion would have
been still livelier and more attractive than herself;
but faithful to her habit of always looking
on the sunny side of a question, she soon took
warm interest in the poor, timid, sorrowful girl
who felt such warm gratitude for her kindness.
She cheered her with smiles and kind words,
divided with her the fruits and flowers presented
to her by her suitors, and was even anxious to
divide with her their attentions; for soft looks
and flattering speeches were so liberally bestowed
on Philippa, that she did not prize them as those
do to whom they are seldom and sparingly administered.
Few men, however, are willing to
be transferred on loan to a young lady of crippled
proportions and stunted fortune; and poor Janet
was compelled to sustain a great deal of rudeness
and inattention from the lords of the creation,
and indeed only met with kindness and civility
from one of them&mdash;the handsome and intellectual
Heathcote, of whom more anon.</p>

<p>I will now return to the point at which my
story began. It was the morning of St. Valentine's
Day, that strange, mysterious day, when
men go out of their national character, become
tender, sentimental, and man&oelig;uvring, purchase
exquisite sheets of paper embellished with
wreaths of flowers, write love verses on them in
a studiously neat, prim hand, seal them with a
fanciful device, and drop them into a post-office
a mile or two from their own residence. Philippa
was seated at a small table covered with
these little fanciful productions, some of which
were yet unopened; she was laughing in the
exuberance of youthful spirits at the hyperbole
contained in one of them.</p>

<p>"And yet, Philippa," said Janet, "I could
almost feel disposed to envy you even for such
light-passing tokens of admiration as are now
lying before you; it is hard, in the very spring
of youth, to feel one's self quite slighted and
forgotten."</p>

<p>"Dear Janet," said the heiress good-humoredly,
"can you really attach any importance to
such a graceful gallantry of society as a valentine?
Depend upon it, the greater number of
those who send them do it merely in observance
of the courteous custom of the day, and forget,
in the formal realities of the next morning, the
fascinations of the goddess whom they have so
recently deified in poetry, or I should rather say
in rhyme."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may be so," replied Janet; "but
at all events you occupied the thoughts of these
your admirers at the time that they were writing
the verses that you estimate so lightly. I can
never hope even for a moment to awaken a
fond and favorable thought; I must pass through
life unnoticed, even in playfulness, unregarded
by all; or, still worse, regarded with pitying
scorn."</p>

<p>"Why do you indulge this morbid sensibility,
my poor Janet?" said Philippa. "You will be
sure to be valued in time by those who discover
your many and rare excellences. What does
the delightful Frederika Bremer say on this subject?
There is in the world so much talent,
so much ingenuity, prudence, wit, genius; but
goodness&mdash;pure, simple, divine goodness&mdash;where
is it to be found?'"</p>

<p>"That is the sentiment of a woman, Philippa,"
replied Janet; "you would never find a man
capable of so pure and delicate a feeling, not
even our favorite Heathcote; by the way, is
Heathcote among your poetical admirers of to-day?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet met with anything half dignified
and sensible enough to come from such a
quarter," said Philippa, scrutinizing, as she spoke,
the varying countenance of her friend. "You
speak of Heathcote as our favorite, Janet; but
I am inclined to suspect that he occupies a much
more considerable portion of your thoughts than
he does of mine."</p>

<p>Philippa was right in her conjecture; the poor
little unsightly Janet had dared to love the
handsome and popular Heathcote, but it was in
silence, in secret, in tears, in humility; not only
did she forbear imparting her love to others, but
she scarcely dared to own it even to herself.
The poet says that</p>

<p class="center">"Love will hope where Reason would despair:"</p>

<p>but Janet had so much reason, and despaired so
wholly and thoroughly, that her love was unvisited
by a single ray of hope. True, Heathcote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was kind and gentle to her; but so he was to
every one. True, he came frequently to the
house; but was that surprising when it was the
residence of one so fair, so charming, so gifted
in every respect as Philippa? Suddenly Philippa
uttered an exclamation of delight as she opened
a fresh valentine; a little case was inclosed
within it, on the outside of which was written
"Portrait of my beloved." Philippa lifted the
lid, and beheld&mdash;her own beautiful features in a
looking-glass!</p>

<p>"This must be Heathcote's simple and feeling
way of avowing his passion," said Janet, with a
half-suppressed sigh.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," said Philippa, "who ever
talks of simple and feeling ways of avowing a
passion in these days of sophistication? and why
will you persist in imagining Heathcote to be
my admirer?"</p>

<p>"If he is not now," said Janet, "I think he
can hardly fail to be."</p>

<p>"Do not give yourself any uneasiness on that
account, Janet," answered the heiress, half in
jest and half in earnest; "if you feel any preference
for Heathcote, I will most cheerfully
make over to you all my right and title to him.
I have given away my heart in another direction,
and fancy that I have gained a heart in
exchange."</p>

<p>"Of that," said Janet, with a sad smile, "I
think there can be little doubt; but who is the
happy man who I conclude has been the donor
of your pretty portrait?"</p>

<p>Janet felt no surprise when her friend mentioned
the name of Captain Warrington, for she
knew him to be warmly attached to Philippa;
he was good-looking, good-humored, and agreeable;
and although his position in society and
his fortune were both inferior to Mr. Chetwode's
ambitious views for his beautiful ward, Janet
foresaw no difficulties in their wooing, which
the perseverance and courage of Philippa, and
the good sense and kindness of her guardian,
would not in a short time clear away. Luncheon
was now announced, and Janet felt that she
should be glad when the day was at an end, the
recurrence of which was one of the many ways
of bringing to her mind the fact that she was
considered by general consent to stand apart from
others of her age and sex, and that an avowal of
love was never destined to reach her eye even
in the masquerade trappings of a valentine.</p>

<p>A few hours afterwards Janet was quietly
reading in her chamber, when a letter was
brought to her. In these days of cheap postage,
when letters descend in a shower on most of us,
and in an avalanche on many, it may seem
strange to say that merely receiving a letter could
be anything but a very commonplace event.
Poor Janet, however, had passed her blighted
youth in the strictest seclusion, and the half-dozen
friends who had known her mother in
the retired country place where she vegetated,
wrote to her at distant intervals, and the handwriting
of each of them was so familiar to her
eye, that she was certain her present correspondent
was not among them.</p>

<p>Janet had no young friends, no admirers, no
debts, no duns; she was poor, and the begging-letter
writers spared her; she had never worked
for fancy fairs, nor written for albums, nor subscribed
to public charities; it was not in her
power to confer a favor on anybody, and people
thus situated escape a vast influx of correspondence.
The letter had been posted in a neighboring
street; the direction was written in an
evidently feigned hand, and the seal bore the
simple impression of a flower. Janet opened it
with a kind of vague feeling that some mystery
clung about it. Little did she dream of the good
fortune that awaited her. The inclosed sheet
of paper was a valentine! It boasted of no
flowers, cupids, hearts, or darts; it was superscribed
"A Valentine to be read when the
others are forgotten."</p>

<p>Delightful phrase! not only was she deemed
worthy of receiving a valentine, but the writer
evidently considered that she had received
others! The charm, however, of this valentine
did not consist in the heading, nor even in the
love-breathing stanzas that followed; but in the
handwriting. It was unquestionably, unmistakably,
the handwriting of Heathcote! There
was a peculiarity in the formation of the letters
that Janet had more than once remarked to
Philippa, when he had written notes on some
trifling subject to their guardian or themselves.
There was no attempt to disguise the hand&mdash;no
attempt to disguise the feelings. These were
the words that electrified poor Janet, or perhaps
I should say "mesmerized" her; for she certainly
seemed translated to a very different kind
of existence from that of the everyday world,
dull and vexatious occasionally to all of us, but
invariably dull and vexatious to her.</p>

<p>Janet felt much as Cinderella may be supposed
to have done when her fairy godmother converted
her ragged attire into a splendid gala-dress. Life
in a moment seemed changed to her view; all
misanthropic fancies, all gloomy forebodings
took flight; she was ready to exclaim, in the
words of the song,</p>

<p class="center">"This world is a beautiful world after all!"</p>

<p>Away with all feelings of jealous longing to share
the advantages of other women! With whom
would she now change? Had she not, misshapen
and unlovely as she was, achieved the conquest of
one who had long appeared, in her eyes, as the
most perfect of human beings? How often had
she fondly wished to possess the beautiful features
and graceful form of Philippa, and yet
Philippa had merely won the homage of gay,
fashionable triflers, while she had received a
declaration of affection from one so dear to her,
that if she had been endowed with the most
brilliant loveliness, and the most lavish wealth,
she would have wished, like Portia, to be for his
sake</p>

<p class="center">"A thousand times more fair&mdash;ten thousand times more rich!"</p>

<p>These raptures may appear to our readers rather
beyond what can be justified by the receipt
of a valentine; but be it remembered that it was
not in the style of a common valentine, that
Heathcote was not a common character, and that
poor Janet had never received even the slightest
token of admiration before that eventful fourteenth
of February. Martin Farquhar Tupper
says, in his "Proverbial Philosophy,"</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"It is a holy thirst to long for Love's requital;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard it will be, hard and sad, to love and be unloved;</div>
  <div class="i0">And many a thorn is thrust into the side of one that is forgotten."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If such, then, be the suffering of the neglected,
what must be the delight of feeling the long-borne
load suddenly removed from the heart!</p>

<p>Janet, after enjoying her newly-found happiness
in solitude for some time, sought her friend
Philippa, who kindly congratulated her on her
acquisition, and reminded her how often she had
told her that she greatly exaggerated the neglect
and unkindness of the world; but Philippa would
not be persuaded into thinking that a valentine
was at all equivalent to a promise of marriage,
or even to a declaration of love.</p>

<p>"You will know better in a little while,
Janet," she said kindly; "but at present I cannot
prevail upon myself to damp your happiness;
you are looking cheerful, and hopeful for the
first time in your life."</p>

<p>Happy indeed was that day to Janet; and the
ensuing one was no less so. Heathcote and a
few other friends dined with Mr. Chetwode,
and in the evening he entered the drawing-room
shortly after Captain Warrington, who had
seated himself between the two young ladies,
and was discoursing to Philippa in a low voice
on the subject of valentines in general, and
doubtless one valentine in particular. Heathcote
took a chair by the side of Janet: her heart
throbbed violently at his approach, but Janet's
eyes and complexion were not of the sort to
betray sudden emotion, and no alteration was
visible in her usually quiet, and somewhat dull
demeanor.</p>

<p>"You will pardon the question I am about to
ask, Miss Penson," said Heathcote, catching a
few words of the conversation between Philippa
and her admirer; "but for the first time in my
life I have been endeavoring to perpetrate poetry,
and have had the presumption to send my
humble attempt to this house, taking advantage
of an occasion when even the most inexperienced
rhymster may anticipate merciful criticism.
May I hope that my offering has not
offended?"</p>

<p>Janet felt for a moment unable to reply, but
her good sense suggested to her that none but
beauties are privileged to be coquettish and tormenting;
therefore she promptly replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"It has not offended."</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Penson," exclaimed Heathcote,
fixing on her his dark, sparkling eyes, full of
pleasure and gratitude, "how kind and amiable
it is of you thus speedily to relieve my anxiety;
but we shall soon be interrupted. I see that the
piano has just been opened: one word more, and
pardon me if it seems abrupt. I have hitherto
visited occasionally at this house; will it be
considered intrusive if my visits become more
frequent?"</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Janet, again exerting herself
to speak calmly and distinctly, "that your
visits here will always be welcome to my guar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>dian&mdash;to
Philippa;" and after a moment's pause
she added, "and to myself."</p>

<p>Heathcote had only time to thank her, by
another of those brief, bright glances, so precious
in her eyes, when she was summoned to the
piano to play the accompaniment to a new ballad,
delightfully warbled by Philippa, and she
was gratified to observe that Heathcote followed
her, and kept his post by the instrument during
the greater part of the evening.</p>

<p>Happy was the little party of lovers during the
next fortnight. Captain Warrington and Heathcote
were constantly at Mr. Chetwode's house,
constantly accompanying Philippa and Janet in
walks, drives, and visits to morning exhibitions.
No young persons ever enjoyed their own way
more than the wards of Mr. Chetwode. He had
a decided aversion to the idea of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dame de compagnie</i>
in the house; consequently, although the
wife of one of his friends always chaperoned
Philippa and Janet in society, their mornings
were entirely at their own disposal. Mr. Chetwode
spent the greater part of every day comfortably
ensconced in his luxurious easy-chair
at the club, wielding a paper-knife in one hand,
and holding a new review, magazine, or pamphlet,
in the other; and if he thought at all about
his wards, he concluded them to be occupied in
netting purses, watering geraniums, petting canaries,
or reading "The Queens of England."</p>

<p>At the end of the fortnight, the member of
the party whom my readers will conclude to be
the happiest began to feel somewhat anxious,
nervous, and discontented. Poor Janet, although
the most humble-minded of living creatures, felt
greatly mortified that her intimacy with Heathcote
did not seem in the slightest manner to progress;
he was still kind, courteous, and considerate
to her, as he had ever been, but nothing
more. She had given him every encouragement
that he could expect, but he did not fulfil the
promises of his poetry; he never uttered a word
that could even be construed into "talking near"
the subject of love. Janet mentioned this apparent
inconsistency to Philippa.</p>

<p>"Did I not warn you, dear Janet," said her
friend, laughingly, "that you were affixing too
much importance to a trifle? You should not
expect an admirer to fulfil all the promises of a
valentine; you might as reasonably expect a
member of Parliament to fulfil the promises
that he had made during his canvass."</p>

<p>Janet, however, would not allow her faith in
valentines to be weakened; she put her own
construction on the coolness of Heathcote, and
a very painful construction it was. She thought
that although for a time his approbation of her
mind and manners had overcome his distaste to
her personal appearance, the latter feeling was
gaining ground upon him, and that he was unable
to love her, and ashamed to introduce her
to the world as the object of his choice. "I will
give him back his faith," thought poor Janet,
little surmising how she would be wondered at
in society for talking of giving back the faith of
a valentine. Before Janet could give Heathcote
back his faith, he was summoned into Shropshire,
to see a married sister who was believed to be
dying; and Janet, instead of pondering over the
uncertainty of her own love-affair, had a different
subject for her attention, in watching the
progress of a far more fortunate wooing. Captain
Warrington, by Philippa's permission, had
spoken to Mr. Chetwode touching his affection
for his beautiful ward; and Mr. Chetwode, after
a slight show of reluctance, and an ineffectual
attempt to induce the young people to consent to
a twelvemonth's engagement, had suffered himself
to be persuaded into a promise that he
would give the bride away whenever she chose
to call upon him to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Chetwode was a very reasonable guardian;
he did not insist on sacrificing his ward to a citizen
whose money-bags outweighed his own;
or to a patrician, whose "face, like his family,
was wonderfully old."</p>

<p>All went on smoothly and satisfactorily; the
lawyers were busy with the settlements, and
Philippa busy with the choice of her wedding-dresses.
But Janet was not without a little
gleam of comfort on her own account.</p>

<p>Heathcote had written to Mr. Chetwode. "My
sister," he wrote, "I am most thankful to say,
is almost convalescent, and in a little while I
shall venture to tell her of an important step in
life that I contemplate taking. I shall then fly
back on the wings of impatience to London, and
need scarcely say that my first visit will be to
your house."</p>

<p>Mr. Chetwode read aloud Heathcote's letter
at the breakfast-table, but made no comment on
the sentence in question. Janet placed her own
construction on it; she thought that Heathcote,
unlike men in general, was a much more ardent
lover when absent than when present, because
he did justice to the qualities of her mind, but
disliked her personal appearance. Moore says
of the heroine of one of his sweet melodies&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"She looked in the glass, which a woman ne'er misses,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor ever wants time for a sly glance or two."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Janet "looked in the glass" not with any
pleasurable sensations; she came to the conclusion
that she grew plainer every day, and she antici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>pated
Heathcote's return with as much fear as
hope. One morning Janet was sitting alone in
the drawing-room, and felt remarkably nervous
and depressed. "Are there such things as presentiments
of evil?" she thought; but her previous
anticipations were changed into joyous
realities when Heathcote was announced. She
started up to greet him, but appearing not to
notice her outstretched hand, he threw himself
into a chair: she thought him very much out
of spirits; an indifferent person would have
thought him very much out of temper.</p>

<p>"Your sister, I trust, is not worse," said Janet,
timidly.</p>

<p>"She is almost well again," he replied impatiently;
"but, had I been aware of what has just
been told me, I do not think I should have troubled
myself to visit London."</p>

<p>"What has been told you?" gasped the agitated
Janet; "you alarm me by your vehemence."</p>

<p>"I have been told," he said, directing a searching
glance at her, "that I have a favored rival,
who not only has taken advantage of my absence
from London to press his suit, but has succeeded
in obtaining a propitious answer to it."</p>

<p>How did Janet's heart beat with rapture!
"Heathcote's love for her could not now be
doubted; he had love enough to be jealous; his
anxious misgivings should immediately be removed;
he should be told that her love was for
him alone."</p>

<p>"You have been deceived, indeed you have
been deceived," she exclaimed; "no rival is
in the case; you cannot love with greater sincerity
and truth than you are loved in return."</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Penson," cried Heathcote, taking
her hand, "how can I thank you sufficiently
for having so promptly relieved my mind from
its groundless suspicions? My sister is prepared
to welcome and to value the object of my choice.
I begin to fancy myself almost too happy; but
I do not see Philippa, and am quite impatient for
an interview."</p>

<p>Again was Janet perplexed by the conduct
of her lover. Why should he speak of her
friend as "Philippa," while he addressed herself
as "Miss Penson?" Why should he seem anxious
for the entrance of Philippa, while enjoying
what ought to be the perfection of happiness to
a lover&mdash;a <em>tête-à-tête</em> with his beloved one?</p>

<p>Even the most humble-minded of women can
feel and resent a palpable slight; and it was
with some little dignity that Janet replied, "Miss
Roxby is not at home at present; Captain Warrington
has accompanied her to the jeweller's;
the wedding is fixed for this day fortnight, and
she is of course so much engaged that I cannot
expect to enjoy a great deal of her society."</p>

<p>Heathcote seemed quite transfixed by this simple
speech. "Philippa's wedding-day fixed!" he
exclaimed angrily; "then you have been cruelly
trifling with my feelings, Miss Penson. Why
did you tell me that I had no rival? Why did
you cheat me into a few minutes of happiness
only to give me deeper and more poignant misery?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," said Janet. "I
feel bewildered and confused; what power can
Philippa's engagement have to affect your tranquillity?
You asked me if I had encouraged a
rival in your absence, and I candidly told you
that my heart was all your own."</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed Heathcote, fixing on her a
look of astonished contempt, as if he thought
her a fitting inmate for a lunatic asylum. "If
you are jesting, Miss Penson, you have chosen
a very inappropriate time for it; if you are in
earnest, I scarcely know whether to regard with
the more pity or anger the absurd vanity which
can have led you to construe common civilities
into individual attachment."</p>

<p>"Your attentions exceeded common civilities,"
faltered the unhappy Janet, as she mentally repeated
some of the soft passages of the valentine.</p>

<p>"In your opinion, perhaps they might," said
Heathcote, with an expression of countenance
somewhat closely bordering on a sneer; "your
personal drawbacks have doubtless been the
cause of obtaining for you the frequent neglect
of the coarse and unfeeling. I certainly, however,
could never have deemed it possible that you
could have supposed yourself likely to inspire
passion in my heart, or in that of any other man,
especially by the side of the brilliant and fascinating
Philippa Roxby. I have serious trouble
enough in losing her, without this ridiculous
and provoking misunderstanding. I advise you
never to expose yourself to sarcasm by making
public to the world your unreasonable expectations;
and, for my part, I am willing to promise
to be equally silent on the subject: let us both
endeavor to forget the untoward conversation
of this morning."</p>

<p>Heathcote's injunctions of secrecy and promise
to be secret were rendered unavailing, for
Mr. Chetwode, who had entered unperceived,
had been the astonished auditor of his last
speech. Heathcote, with the instinctive dislike
that all selfish men feel to the idea of "a scene,"
uttered a few hasty words of apology to Mr.
Chetwode, and made a speedy escape, while the
astonished guardian took a seat near Janet in
silence: he felt hurt and annoyed; no one likes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to meet with vexations that they have not anticipated,
and certainly Mr. Chetwode had never
dreamed that his poor little ward, Janet, would
give him any trouble about her love affairs.</p>

<p>"My dear Janet," he said at length, "I gather
from the few words that I heard on entering
the room, that you have construed some slight
civilities, shown you by Mr. Heathcote, into
proofs of a serious attachment. I am sorry and
also surprised that you should have fallen under
such a misapprehension; for it was quite evident
to me, and to many others, that Mr. Heathcote
was an admirer of Philippa."</p>

<p>Janet removed her hands from her face, and
steadily met the glance of her guardian. "I
assure you," she said, "that I have received
more than slight attentions from Mr. Heathcote;
Philippa is aware of it, and there has never been
any feeling of rivalry between us; he declared
his affection for me some weeks ago."</p>

<p>Mr. Chetwode could not avoid giving rather a
discourteous start of amazement; but quickly
remembering the proverb, that "there is no
accounting for tastes," he said, in a kinder tone
of voice, "And how did he make this avowal
to you, my dear?"</p>

<p>"By letter," replied Janet.</p>

<p>Mr. Chetwode began to feel exceedingly indignant
with Heathcote. To write a declaration
of love to a young lady, and then, without assigning
any reason for his conduct, to break faith with
her, was, he justly thought, highly blamable under
any circumstances, and peculiarly mysterious
under those of poor Janet, since a lover who
could once forget her personal disadvantages
must be very much in love indeed, and could not
have the shadow of an excuse for changing his
mind afterwards, as the qualities of her mind
and temper were such as to improve upon acquaintance.
"Have you any objection, Janet,"
he said, "to show me this letter?"</p>

<p>"It is not a letter," faltered Janet, "it is a
copy of verses."</p>

<p>Mr. Chetwode hastily rose from his chair, and
walked up and down the room as an escape-valve
for his irritation. He could not bring himself
to say a harsh word to the suffering girl before
him, but he felt thoroughly provoked with her.
Mr. Chetwode was an essentially prosaic, matter-of-fact
man, and had once seriously offended
a young poet of his acquaintance by averring that
he considered poetry "as a cramp way of people
saying what they wanted to say!" He controlled,
however, his inclination to be very bitter and
caustic on the occasion, and merely said, "Your
inexperience, my poor Janet, has wofully misled
you; young men present copies of verses as
they do boxes of <em>bon-bons</em> to several of their lady
friends in succession, and mean no more by the
one trifle than the other; endeavor, my dear,
to forget the past, and resolve to be more wise
in future."</p>

<p>Thus saying, Mr. Chetwode left the room,
went to his club, and after remaining there an
hour, took a few turns in St. James's-park, where
he was somewhat annoyed to encounter Heathcote.
He had, however, no opportunity of escaping
him; for Heathcote, who felt a little
ashamed of his recent behavior, joined him, and
made some inquiries respecting Philippa, lamenting
his own ill-fortune in not having been able
to make himself acceptable to her.</p>

<p>"Philippa has chosen for herself," replied
Mr. Chetwode, somewhat coldly, "and I see no
reason to object to her choice. I am sorry, Mr.
Heathcote, that you should have considered yourself
obliged to make love to both my wards. I
do not attach any importance to such a trifle as
a copy of verses; but poor Janet, who has, as
you may easily conclude, been unused to the
slightest attention, actually considered that you
were making an offer of your heart in rhyme,
and has sadly felt the disappointment of her
hopes."</p>

<p>"Write verses to Miss Penson!" repeated
Heathcote, in a half-derisive, half-astonished
tone; "I never did such a thing, never dreamed
of doing it; whoever told you so, my dear sir,
has most grossly deceived you."</p>

<p>"I heard it," replied Mr. Chetwode angrily,
"from the lips of one whose truth has never
been doubted&mdash;from poor Janet herself."</p>

<p>"I can only repeat my asseveration," said
Heathcote, "and am ready to do it in the presence
of Miss Penson, of whose truthfulness I must
beg to entertain a less favorable opinion than
you seem to do; perhaps, however, some one
has been sporting with her vanity, by writing
verses to her in my name, in which case she is
to be pitied."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Mr. Chetwode, thoughtfully.
And he parted from Heathcote, and pursued
his way home.</p>

<p>Janet was in her own chamber, but he sent to
desire her presence.</p>

<p>"I am very much inclined, my poor girl,"
he said kindly, "from some hints which have
been given to me, to surmise that the verses to
which you allude were not sent to you by Heathcote,
but by some one who successfully imitated
his hand."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, dear sir," replied Janet;
"not only were the verses unquestionably in
the hand-writing of Heathcote, but he alluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to them the next day in conversation with me,
and expressed his hope that they had not given
offence."</p>

<p>"And yet, Janet," said her guardian, fixing
his eyes sternly on her, "it is from Heathcote
himself that I have just heard the suggestion
that his hand-writing has been counterfeited;
he most strongly and utterly denies that he has
ever written verses to you."</p>

<p>"I am concerned," said Janet, "that Heathcote
should show himself not only deficient in
honor and kindness, but in common truth and
honesty. You, however, my dear sir, who have
so long known me, will not, I am sure, feel a
moment's hesitation in believing my statement
in preference to his."</p>

<p>Mr. Chetwode did not speak, but he regarded
Janet with a look by no means indicative of the
perfect trust which she had anticipated. She
burst into tears.</p>

<p>At this moment Philippa entered, radiant with
beauty, health, and happiness, having just parted
from her lover at the door. She stood astonished
at the scene that met her eyes.</p>

<p>"Philippa," said Mr. Chetwode, gravely, "you
will be sorry to hear that you must either think
very ill of a favorite friend, or of a pleasant acquaintance.
A circumstance has arisen, trifling
in itself, but involving the veracity either of
Janet or of Heathcote; she avers that a few
weeks ago he wrote verses to her, containing a
declaration of love; he denies that he did any
such thing."</p>

<p>Philippa turned very pale, and sat down in
silence.</p>

<p>"On what occasion were these verses written?"
said Mr. Chetwode, turning to Janet with
a predetermined air of disbelief in the reality
of them.</p>

<p>"They were entitled," said Janet, "'A valentine,
to be read when the others are forgotten.'"</p>

<p>"A valentine!" repeated Mr. Chetwode, indignantly;
"and is it possible that the verses of
which you speak as containing an avowal of affection,
almost amounting to a promise of marriage,
were nothing but a valentine? and have
I been induced, by your misrepresentations, to
reprove and lecture a young man for adding one
to the many chartered blockheads who commit
fooleries to paper on Valentine's Day? I no
longer doubt your truth, Janet; but I have serious
doubts of your sanity. You, Philippa, also,"
he added, turning to her, "have been much to
blame; you know more of the world than Janet;
why did you let her make herself so ridiculous
as she has been pleased to do?"</p>

<p>"Do not censure Philippa," said Janet; "my
sorrows have been all of my own making: she
repeatedly told me that I affixed far too much
consequence to so trifling a mark of attention as
a valentine."</p>

<p>"Dearest Janet, forgive me," cried Philippa,
in much agitation; "I will make now, in the
presence of our guardian, a confession that I
ought to have made before. I have been acting
as your enemy, when my only wish was to be
your friend. You remember our conversation
on Valentine's Day. When I repaired to my
dressing-room after luncheon, I perceived that
one of my valentines was unopened; I broke
the seal, the writing within was in the hand of
Heathcote; and without even reading it, I inclosed
it in a blank envelop, directed it to you,
and put it into the post that morning. I wished
to give you a few minutes' pleasure, and to prove
to you that you were not quite forgotten. I knew
Heathcote to be a favorite with you, and imagined
that you would be gratified by his attention.
When you brought the verses, and read
them to me, I was surprised at their warmth and
earnestness, and repented of what I had done,
and I have repented more and more ever since."</p>

<p>"And those verses were never intended for
me!" exclaimed the weeping Janet. "Heathcote
never felt a moment's preference for me!
Oh, Philippa! I know you intended kindness to
me, but this was cruel kindness."</p>

<p>And poor Janet now indeed felt the cope-stone
placed on her humiliation; she would have
much rather believed Heathcote to be fickle and
inconstant, than have discovered that he had
never loved her at all. She pressed Philippa's
hand, however, in token of forgiveness, and
left the room; and the bride elect, for the first
time in her life, was called upon to listen to a
lecture from her guardian, beginning with some
strictures on her own officious folly, continuing
with a few allusions to the vanity and blindness
of her friend Janet, and concluding with an
earnestly expressed hope that none of his friends
would ever place a young lady under his guardianship
again!</p>

<p>Philippa's wedding-day arrived. Janet was
present at it, not as a bridesmaid, for she had
refused to spoil the group of beautiful girls who
appeared in that character by joining them&mdash;she
was plainly and quietly dressed; none among
the brilliant assemblage prayed more fervently
than she did for the happiness of Philippa; but
her cheek grew paler than ever, and her tears
fell fast, as she listened to the solemn ceremony,
feeling that similar vows could never be plighted
to herself, and that domestic happiness was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
much beyond her reach as if she had been a
being of another sphere. She left London on
that day to return to the village where her mother
died, and where she took up her residence
with an old friend, with whom she had previously
communicated by letter.</p>

<p>Almost a year has elapsed since that time:
she is calm and composed, but her spirits have
never recovered the severe shock that they have
sustained; she feels that for a short time she
was living in an unreal region, and her violent
descent to earth has humbled and bewildered
her. Had she never been led to fancy that she
was an object of tenderness and affection, her
good sense would in time have reconciled her to
the disadvantages under which she labored; but
the fitful light thrown across her path only served
to make the darkness more unbearable when it
was withdrawn. Mr. Chetwode and Philippa
have each requested her to visit them, but she
has resolutely excused herself from again joining
a world for which she feels herself alike unfitted
in person and in spirit.</p>

<p>The marriage of Philippa and Captain Warrington
has, to use the words of Theodore Hook,
produced as much "happiness for two" as the
world can be expected to give. Philippa is as
charming as ever, and in one respect her character
has materially improved. Formerly, Philippa,
partly from good-nature, and partly from a
wish to be universally popular, was very much in
the habit of saying things to her friends that were
more pleasant than true; she would tell fourth-rate
poetasters that everybody was in raptures
with their genius; she would assure mothers
that their sickly pedantic prodigies were extolled
in every circle; and she would protest to faded
spinsters that the gentlemen declared them to be
handsomer than they were a dozen years ago.
Now, however, Philippa, although still kind and
courteous, is as particular in the veracity of her
civil speeches as if she had studied Mrs. Opie's
"Illustrations of Lying" for the last five years:
and all are delighted to obtain her praise, because
all feel that she is sincere in bestowing it.</p>

<p>One day her husband found her in tears, and
anxiously inquired the reason of her sorrow.</p>

<p>"It will soon pass away," she said; "but I
have just been thinking with grief and repentance
of a very faulty action in my life, although
you, to console me, are in the habit of calling it
an amiable weakness. I allude to my unjustifiable
imposition on poor Janet; the present day
causes it to recur most forcibly to my mind&mdash;it
is the anniversary of <span class="smcap">Valentine's Day</span>!"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FOUNTAIN_VERY_FAR_DOWN" id="THE_FOUNTAIN_VERY_FAR_DOWN"></a>THE FOUNTAIN VERY FAR DOWN.</h2>

<p class="p8">BY VIRGINIA F. TOWNSEND.</p>


<p>"I don't believe it," said my cousin Ned,
who was passing his college vacation at our
house, and there was a world of unwritten scepticism
in the air with which he dashed down
the paper over whose damp columns his eyes
had been travelling for the previous half hour.</p>

<p>"You see, Cousin Nelly," continued Ned,
getting up and pacing the long old-fashioned
parlor with quick, nervous strides, "it's all
sheer nonsense to talk about these doors in every
human heart. It sounds very pretty and pathetic
in a story, I'll admit; but so do a great many
other things which reason and actual experience
entirely repudiate. There are hearts&mdash;alas!
that their name should be legion&mdash;where 'far
away up' there is no door to be opened, and 'far
away down' are no deeps to be fathomed. Now
don't, Cousin Nelly, level another such rebuking
glance at me from those brown eyes, for I
have just thought of a case illustrative of my
theory. Don't you remember Miss Stebbins,
the old maid, who lived at the foot of the hill,
and how I picked a rose for you one morning
which had climbed over her fence into the road,
and so, of course, became 'public property?'
Faugh! I shall never forget the tones of the
virago's voice, or the scowl on her forehead as
she sallied out of the front door and shook her
hand at me. A woman who could refuse a half
withered flower to a little child, I wonder that
roses could blossom on her soil! At the 'smiting
of the rod,' no waters could flow out of such
a granite heart. In the moral desert of such a
character, no fertilizing stream can make its way."</p>

<p>I did not answer Cousin Ned's earnest, eloquent
tones, for just then there was the low rap
of visitors at the parlor door; but I have always
thought there was a good angel in the room
while he was speaking, and that it flew straight
to Miss Stebbins, and looking down, down, very
far down in her heart, he saw a fountain there,
rank weeds grew all around it, the seal of years
was on its lip, and the dust of time deep on the
seal; but the angel smiled, as it floated upward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and murmured, "I shall return and remove the
seal, and the waters will flow."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stern and grim sat Miss Stebbins at her work,
one summer afternoon. The golden sunshine
slept and danced in its play-place in the corner,
and broke into a broad laugh along the ceiling,
and a single beam, bolder than the rest, crept to
the hem of Miss Stebbins's gown, and looked
up with a timid, loving smile in her face, such
as no human being ever wore when looking
there.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Stebbins! those stern, harsh features
only daguerreotyped too faithfully the
desolate, arid heart beneath them; and that
heart, with its dry fountain, was a true type of
her life, with the one flower of human affection
which had blossomed many years before along
its bleak, barren highway.</p>

<p>She never seemed to love anybody, unless it
was her brother William, who was a favorite
with everybody; but he went to sea, and had
never been heard of since. Sally had always
been a stray sheep among the family; but dark
hours, and at last <em>death</em>, came upon all the rest,
and so the homestead fell into her hands. Such
was the brief verbal history of Miss Stebbins's
life, which I received from Aunt Mary, who
closed it there, in rigid adherence to her favorite
maxim, never to speak evil of her neighbors.</p>

<p>But, that summer afternoon, there came the
patter of children's feet along the gravel-walk
which led to Miss Stebbins's front door; and, at
the same moment, the angel with golden-edged
wings came down from its blue-sky home into
Miss Stebbins's parlor.</p>

<p>She raised her head and saw them, two weary-looking
little children, with golden hair and blue
eyes, standing hand in hand under the little portico,
and then that old termagant scowl darkened her
forehead, and she asked, with a sharp, disagreeable
note in her voice, like the raw breath in
the north-east wind&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wa-all! I should like to know what you
want standing there?"</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am," said the boy, in a timid, entreating
voice, which ought to have found its
way straight into any heart, "little sister and I
feel very tired, for we have walked a long way.
Will you let us sit down on the step and rest a
little while?"</p>

<p>"No; I can't have children loafing round on
my premises," said Miss Stebbins, with the same
vinegar sharpness of tone which had characterized
her preceding reply. Moreover, the sight
of any of the miniature specimens of her race
seemed always fated to arouse her belligerent
propensities. "So just take yourselves off; and
the quicker, the better 'twill be for you."</p>

<p>"Don't stay any longer, Willy. I am afraid,"
whispered the little girl, with a tremor rippling
through her voice, as she pulled significantly at
her brother's coat sleeve.</p>

<p>"Willy! Willy! That was your brother's
name; don't you remember?" the angel bent
down and whispered very softly in the harsh
woman's ear; and all the time his hand was
gliding down, down in her heart, searching for
that hidden fountain. "You must have been
just about that little girl's age when you and he
used to go trudging down into the meadows together
to find sweet flagroot. And you used to
keep tight hold of his hand, just as she does.
Oh, how tired you used to get! Don't you remember
that old brown house, where nobody
lived but starved rats and a swarm of wasps, who
made their nest there in the summer-time? And
you used to sit down on the old step, which the
worms had eaten in so many places, and rest
there. How he loved you! and how careful he
was always to give you the best seat! and, then,
he never spoke one cross word to you, if everybody
else did. Now, if you should let those
children sit down and rest, just as you and Willy
did on the old brown step, you could keep a
sharp eye on them, to see they didn't get into
any mischief."</p>

<p>The angel must have said all this in a very
little time, for the children had only reached the
gravel-walk again, when Miss Stebbins called
out to them; and, this time, that spiteful little
note in her voice was not quite so prominent&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, you may sit right down on that corner
a little while; but, mind you, don't stir; for,
if you do, you'll have to budge."</p>

<p>"Little sister," said the boy, in a low tone,
after they were seated, "lay your head here, and
try to go to sleep."</p>

<p>The little girl laid her head, with its shower
of golden bright curls, on her brother's breast;
but, the next moment, she raised it, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can't sleep, brother, I'm so thirsty."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember that day you and Willy
went into the woods after blackberries, and how
you lost your way groping in the twilight of the
forest?" again whispered the angel, with his
hand feeling all the time for the fountain. "You
found an old lightning-blasted tree, and you sat
down on it, and he put his arm round you just
so, and said, 'Try and go to sleep, little sister.'
But you couldn't, you were so thirsty; for you
had walked full three miles. Who knows but
what those children have, too?"</p>

<p>There was a little pause after the angel had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
said this, and then Miss Stebbins rose up and
went into her pantry, where the shelves were
all of immaculate whiteness, and she could see
her face in the brightly scoured tin. She brought
out a white pitcher, and, going into the garden,
filled it at the spring. Returning, she poured
some of the cool contents into a cup which stood
on the table, and carried it to the children; and
she really held it to the little girl's lips all the
time she was drinking.</p>

<p>Farther and farther down in the heart of the
woman crept the hand of the angel; nearer and
nearer to the fountain it drew.</p>

<p>Miss Stebbins went back to her sewing, but,
somehow, her fingers did not fly as nimbly as
usual. The memories of bygone years were rising
out of their mouldy sepulchres; but all
freshly they came before her, with none of the
grave's rust and dampness upon them.</p>

<p>"That little boy's eyes, when he thanked you
for the water, looked just as Willy's used to,"
once more whispered the angel, bending down
close to Miss Stebbins's ear. "And his hair
looks like Willy's, too, as he sits there with that
sunbeam brightening its gold, and his arm thrown
so lovingly around his sister's waist. There!
did you see how wistfully he looked up at the
grapes, whose purple side are turned towards
him as they hang over the portico? How Willy
used to love grapes! And how sweet your bowls
of bread and milk used to taste, after one of
your rambles into the woods! If those children
have walked as far as you did&mdash;and don't you
see the little boy's coat and the little girl's faded
dress are all covered with dust?&mdash;they must be
very hungry, as well as tired and thirsty. Don't
you remember that apple-pie you baked this
morning? I never saw a pie done to a finer
brown in my life. How sweet it would taste to
those little tired things, if they could only eat a
piece here in the parlor, where the flies and the
sun wouldn't keep tormenting them all the
time!"</p>

<p>A moment after, Miss Stebbins had stolen with
noiseless step to her pantry, and, cutting out two
generous slices from her apple-pie, she placed
them in saucers, returned to the front door, and
said to the children&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may come in here, and sit down on the
stools by the fire-place and eat some pie; but
you must mind and not drop any crumbs on the
floor."</p>

<p>It was very strange, but that old harsh tone
had almost left her voice. The large, tempting
slices were placed in the little hands eagerly
lifted up to receive them; and, at that moment,
out from the lip of the fountain, out from the
dust which lay heavy upon its seal, there came
a single drop, and it fell down upon Miss Stebbins's
heart. It was the first which had fallen
there for years. Ah, the angel had found the
fountain then!</p>

<p>The softened woman went back to her seat,
and the angel did not bend down and whisper
in her ear again; but all the time his hand was
busy, very busy at its work.</p>

<p>"Where is your home, children?" inquired
Miss Stebbins, after she had watched for a while,
with a new, pleasant enjoyment, the children,
as they dispatched with hungry avidity their pie.</p>

<p>"Mary and I haven't any home now. We
had one once before papa died, a great way over
the sea," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"And where are you going now? and what
brought you and your little sister over the sea?"
still farther queried the now interested woman.</p>

<p>"Why, you see, ma'am, just before papa died,
he called old Tony to him&mdash;now, Tony was
black, and always lived with us&mdash;'Tony,' said
he, 'I am going to die, and you know I have
lost everything, and the children will be all alone
in the world. But, Tony, I had a sister once
that I loved, and she loved me; and, though I
haven't seen her for a great many years, still I
know she loves me, if she's living, just as well
as she did when she and I used to go hand in
hand through the apple-orchard to school; and,
Tony, when I'm dead and buried, I want you
to sell the furniture, and take the money it
brings you and carry the children back to New
England. You'll find her name and the place
she used to live in a paper&mdash;which anybody'll
read for you&mdash;in the drawer there. And, Tony,
when you find her, just take Willy and Mary to
her, and tell her I was their father, and that I
sent them to her on my death-bed, and asked her
to be a mother to them for my sake. It'll be
enough, Tony, to tell her that.' And Tony
cried real loud, and he said, 'Massa, if I forget
one word of what you've said, may God forget
me.'</p>

<p>"Well, papa died, and, after he was buried,
Tony brought little sister and me over the waters.
But, before we got here, Tony was taken
sick with the fever, and he died a little while
after the ship reached the land and they had
carried him on shore. But, just before he died,
he called me to him and put a piece of paper in
my hand. 'Don't lose it, Willy,' he said, 'for
poor Tony's going, and you'll have to find the
way to your aunt's all alone. The money's all
spent, too, and they say it's a good hundred
miles to the place where she lived. But keep
up a good heart, and ask the folks the way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
for something to eat when you're hungry; and
don't walk too many miles a day, 'cause little
sister ain't strong. Perhaps somebody'll help
you on with a ride, or let you sleep in their
house nights. Now don't forget, Willy; and
shake hands the last time with poor Tony.'</p>

<p>"After that, we stayed at the inn till the next
day, when they buried Tony; and, when they
asked us what we were going to do, we told
them we were going to our aunt's, for papa had
sent us to her, and then they let us go. When
we asked folks the way they told us, though
they always stared, and sometimes shook their
heads. We got two rides, and always a good
place to sleep. They said our aunt lived round
here; but, we got so tired walking, we had to
stop."</p>

<p>"And what was your father's name?" asked
Miss Stebbins, and, somehow, there was a choking
in her throat, and the hand of the angel was
placed on the fountain as she spoke.</p>

<p>"William Stebbins; and our aunt's name was
Sally Stebbins. Please, ma'am, do you know
her?"</p>

<p>Off, at that moment, came the seal, and out
leaped a fresh, blessed tide of human affection,
and fell down upon the barren heart-soil that
grew fertile in a moment.</p>

<p>"William! my brother William!" cried Miss
Stebbins, as she sprang towards the children
with outstretched arms and tears raining fast
down her cheeks. "Oh, for your sake, I will
be a mother to them!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A year had passed away; college vacation had
come again, and once more Cousin Ned was at
our house. In the summer gloaming we went
to walk, and our way lay past Miss Stebbins's
cottage. As we drew near the wicket, the sound
of merry child-laughter rippled gleefully to our
ears, and a moment after, from behind that very
rose-tree so disagreeably associated with its
owner in Cousin Ned's mind, bounded two
golden-haired children.</p>

<p>"Come, Willy! Mary! you have made
wreaths of my roses until they are wellnigh
gone. You must gather violets after this."</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mirabile dictu!</i>" ejaculated Cousin Ned.
"Is <em>that</em> the woman who gave me such a blessing
a long time ago for plucking a half withered
rose from that very tree?"</p>

<p>"The very same, Cousin Ned," I answered;
and then I told him of the change which had
come over the harsh woman, of her love, her
gentleness, and patience for the orphan children
of her brother; and that, after all, there was a
fountain very far down in her heart, as there
surely was in everybody's, if we could only
find it.</p>

<p>"Well, Cousin Nelly," said Ned, "I'll agree
to become a convert to your theory without further
demurring, if you'll promise to tell me
where to find a hidden fountain that lies very
far down in a dear little somebody's heart, and
whose precious waters are gushing only for me."</p>

<p>There was a glance, half arch, half loving,
from those dark, handsome eyes, which made
me think Cousin Ned knew he would not have
to go very far to find it.</p>

<h2><a name="VEGETABLE_PHYSIOLOGY" id="VEGETABLE_PHYSIOLOGY"></a>VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY.</h2>

<p class="p8">BY HARLAND COULTAS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Process of Fertilization.</span>&mdash;All organic
beings, animals, and plants reproduce
themselves by means of fecundated germs, which
we call embryos. The embryos of plants form
in a particular organ called an ovule, and the
matter which fecundates them is termed pollen.</p>

<p>The character of an embryo in organic beings
is that it contains, in a rudimentary state, all
the organs of which the organic being is composed
in its entire developments. Thus, in the
animal, the uterine f&oelig;tus is composed of the
head, the trunk, and the extremities; in other
words, of all the parts of which the adult animal
is composed. In like manner, the embryos
of plants, like those of animals, contain all the
parts which compose the fabric of the fully developed
plant in a rudimentary condition. The
embryo of a bean, for example, consists of a
plumule or young stem, a pair of leaves or
cotyledons, and a radicle or young root, or
the entire plant in a rudimentary state; and,
by the act of germination, analogous in its
effects to the commencement of life in the extra-uterine
f&oelig;tus, all the parts of the plant develop
themselves into their wonted figure and hues,
in accordance with those <em>peculiar</em> organic laws
to which the plant is subjected. But germination
does not increase the number of these parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which existed before its influence was exercised
on them.</p>

<p>Now, plants have sexes, or sexual organs, as
well as animals. The female sexual organs in
plants are named carpels. The pistil, already
described, consisting of stigma, style, and germen,
is only a fully developed carpel. The
male sexual organs are named stamens, the anthers
of which contain the pollen or fecundating
matter. The stamens and carpels are therefore
the essential organs of reproduction in plants,
since it is by the mutual action of these bodies
that the embryo of the future plant is formed,
and the same form of life continued in the earth.
Fig. 1 is a representation of a petal, stamen, and
the pistil of Berberis vulgaris, or the common
barberry. In this plant, the anthers open by two
valves to let out the pollen. These valves are
seen in the figure, and the pistil is exhibited in
section, to show the ovules in the cavity of the
germen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_149abig.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>The reproductive organs only appear at the
epoch when plants attain the full development
of all their parts, or arrive at an adult
state. The period when this occurs varies
greatly in each species, and depends entirely on
the peculiarities of its constitution. When this
epoch arrives, a visible change takes place in
the organic functions; the stem ceases to elongate,
and its internodes no longer developing,
the leaves remain crowded together in closely
approximated whorls, and, after undergoing
those peculiar modifications in form and coloring
which we have already described, a flower is
produced.</p>

<p>The process of fecundation appears to be as
follows: As soon as the calyx and corolla are
fully expanded, the stamens rapidly develop,
their filaments elongate, and the anthers, at first
moist and closed, become dry, and, rupturing,
discharge the pollen on the stigma of the pistil,
which at this time is bedewed with a clammy
fluid, which serves to retain the grains of pollen
that fall upon its surface. The grains
of pollen, after remaining for some time on the
humid stigma, absorb its moisture, and are seen
to swell so that those which are elliptical assume
a spherical form. The thin and highly extensible
intine or inner covering of the pollen grain
ultimately is pushed, in the form of a tube,
through one of the pores or ostioles in the surface
of the extine or outer covering, the mode
of dehiscence of the pollen grain being always
determined by the character of its surface. The
pollen tube enters the lax tissue of the stigma,
and, by gradual increments of growth,
pushes its way down the style into the germen
or ovary in which the ovules are found, up to
this period, unfertilized. The tube enters one
of the unimpregnated ovules through a small
hole called the micropyle (from μικξος a little,
πυλη gate), conveying the fecundating fluid matter
contained in the cavity of the grain into the
young ovule. This fluid matter is called fovilla,
and its flow through the pollen tube is easily
perceived by the movement of those microscopic
corpuscles which it contains.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 2 is a section through the stigma, and
part of the style of Antirrhinum majus, or the
common snapdragon. The pollen grains are seen
adhering to the surface of the stigma, and the
tube is pushing its way down the pistil to the
germen.</p>

<p>The ovules having received the impregnating
matter, the flower loses its beauty, and nothing
remains but the germen, which swells into a
fruit abounding with seeds, by which the species
is continued. An attentive observer may watch
these changes throughout the summer months
in any plant that produces flowers and fruit,
and may thus satisfy himself of the general correctness
of these statements.</p>

didn't go out 'cause 'twas necessary that I should,
for at my father's there was a house full of

when I found how 'twas, I consented to go, for
it seemed to me a sin and a shame&mdash;what I called
right down heathenish&mdash;to let the woman suffer
for want of bein' took keer on. I didn't expect
that I should suit in everything; but I felt detarmined,
in my own mind, to put the best foot
for'ard, and exart every narve to the utmost to
do the best I could, and that was all that could
be expected of anybody.</p>

<p>"They were both so tickled to think I consented
to come, that they neither of 'em uttered
a single word of complaint for the two first days.
All I said or did was jest right. I was young,
and didn't understand a dreadful deal about
cookin'; but Aunt Keziah wasn't as sick but
what she could give off the orders, so I got along
nicely. The third day she said to me, arter
breakfast&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tabitha, I guess I'll have a rice puddin'
made for dinner to-day. A rice puddin', if 'tis
made jest right, is Mr. Higgins's favorite.'</p>

<p>"So she told me how to proportionate all the
'gred'encies&mdash;how many eggs, how much rice,
sugar, milk, and everything. I mustn't vary the
vally of a thimbleful in an individwal thing, she
said, 'cause, if I did, it wouldn't suit Mr. Higgins.
The sass to eat on't, too, must be made
jest so.</p>

<p>"Well, I told her I'd do my best; and I did.
If the rice, sugar, and so on had been goold dust,
I couldn't 'ave been an atom more partic'lar
about measurin' 'em; and, arter I got the puddin'
into the oven, I watched it as narrer as
ever a cat watched a mouse, so as to be sure
'twas bakin' jest fast enough, and none too fast.</p>

<p>"When 'twas drawin' along towards dinner-time,
I thought I'd hunt up a dish to turn the
puddin' into, 'cause, you see, I baked it in a
brown, airthen dish that wa'n't fit to set on the
table. Well, I come across a deep, blue-edged
one, jest like one we had at home, that my mother
bought on purpose to put puddin' into. We
were to have, besides the puddin', a grand good
b'iled dish&mdash;pork and corned beef, and all sorts
of garding-sass, sich as cabbage, turnips, bates,
carriots, and so on. 'Twas no fool of a job to
prepare so many kinds of sass; but I didn't vally
the trouble, all I aimed at was to suit Uncle
Higgins. When I'd got everything on the table,
they looked so nice I felt quite proud. Accordin'
to my mind, 'twas a dinner fit to set afore a
king.</p>

<p>"Uncle Higgins was blest with an amazin'
good appetite, and, I tell you, he did good justice
to the b'iled dish. Arter a while, he begun to
slack off a leetle mite, and I could see him
eyein' the puddin' purty sharp. At last, says
he&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What 'ave you got there, Tabitha?'</p>

<p>"'A rice puddin', sir,' says I.</p>

<p>"'A rice puddin'?' says he.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' says I.</p>

<p>"'Well, then, I guess you never sarved much
of a 'prenticeship at making rice puddin's,' says
he.</p>

<p>"'If you'll jest taste of it, sir, I guess you'll
like it,' says I.</p>

<p>"'I sha'n't taste of sich a lookin' thing as
that,' says he, and up he jumps from the table,
appearantly jest as mad as a March hare.</p>

<p>"I felt purty much riled myself, and should
'ave been glad if the tarnal puddin' had been
right in the middle of the Red Sea. Arter I'd
taken so much pains, worried myself e'en jest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to death about it, as 'twere, I thought 'twas too
bad for him to speak about it in sich a short,
scornful way.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell Aunt Keziah anything about it,
'cause, as she was sick, I was afeared 'twould
worry her; but, afore I'd finished doin' the
work up arter dinner, Uncle Higgins got cooled
down a leetle atom, and went into aunt's room
to see how she was. She mistrusted by his looks
that everything wasn't raly right, so she says to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"'How did the dinner suit you?'</p>

<p>"'Well enough,' says he.</p>

<p>"'Did Tabitha make the rice puddin' to yer
likin'?' says she.</p>

<p>"'I didn't eat any rice puddin',' says he.
'There was a mushy-lookin' thing on the table
that she <em>called</em> a rice puddin'; but it didn't look
like an eatable to me.'</p>

<p>"'What appeared to be the matter with it?'
says Aunt Keziah.</p>

<p>"'Why, one thing that ailed it was, there
wa'n't a drop of whey in it; 'twas dry as a contribution-box,
and you know I never eat sich
puddin's.'</p>

<p>"'I guess you put a leetle too much rice in
your puddin' accordin' to the other gred'ences,'
says Aunt Keziah, the first time I went into the
room arter Uncle Higgins was gone.</p>

<p>"'I put in jest as much as you said I must,'
says I.</p>

<p>"'Well,' says she, 'Mr. Higgins told me 'twas
too dry&mdash;that there wa'n't any whey in it.'</p>

<p>"'If that's all,' says I, 'I'll try my luck
ag'in to-morrow, and make jest the same, on'y
scant the rice the least mite that ever was.'</p>

<p>"'So do,' says Aunt Keziah. 'I rather guess
you were a leetle too heavy-handed when you
measured the rice.'</p>

<p>"Well, I do declare that I didn't think of
anything but that tarnal rice puddin' all the
arternoon; and, the minute I fell asleep at
night, rice puddin's were settin' round in every
direction, jest as thick as a swarm of bees. Once
I thought I went to draw a pail of water, when
up came a bucket full of rice puddin'. Then,
ag'in, I thought I was starchin' some of Aunt
Keziah's best caps, and found I'd been dippin'
'em in a mess of rice puddin', instead of starch.
That was the way I was tormented all night
long. My sleep didn't do me an atom of good;
but, arter breakfast, I brightened up a little, and
felt detarmined in my own mind, if there was
any sich thing as makin' a rice puddin' that
would suit Uncle Higgins, I would do it. So I
went to work, and, the land o' massy! if I should
live to be as old as Methuselah, and forty years
on to the eend of that, I shall never forgit how
I fussed and worried over that 'ere puddin'. If
I measured the rice once, I raly b'l'eve that I
measured it half a dozen times, so that, at last,
I got to be so addle-pated that I could 'ave hardly
told B from a broomstick.</p>

<p>"Aunt Keziah said there sartainly couldn't
be any danger of its bein' too dry; and, if it
erred a leetle bit on t'other hand, I could dip
out two or three spoonfuls of the whey.</p>

<p>"I don't know how the President feels to be
at the head of government; but, if the affairs
of the nation weigh as heavy on his shoulders as
that puddin' did on mine all the time 'twas
bakin', he'd soon give up beat.</p>

<p>"There was never anything that looked a
mite nicer than it did when I took it out of the
oven. 'Twas enough to make a pairson's mouth
water to look at it; but, the moment I put the
tarnal thing into the deep, blue-edged dish, it
looked 'xact as t'other did, on'y, if anything, a
leetle more mushy, as Uncle Higgins called it.
If there'd been time, I'd 'ave gone off by myself
and had a good cryin' spell. It was my
fairm belief that the puddin' was bewitched.
What to do I didn't know. One minute I
thought I'd put it on the table, and Uncle Higgins
might eat some of it or not, jest as he was a
mind to. The next minute, I made up my mind
to hide it away, and not let him know that I'd
made one. I was right in the midst of my
quandary, when, the first thing I knew, Uncle
Higgins walked into the kitchen, and marched
right up to the table, where sot the puddin'.</p>

<p>"'What do you call that?' says he.</p>

<p>"'A rice puddin',' says I; and, judgin' by my
feelin's, I turned all manner of colors.</p>

<p>"'Well, don't put sich a lookin' thing as that
on to the table,' says he. 'It don't look fit to
be sot afore anybody but a heathen. I've no
notion of havin' what leetle appetite I've got
sp'ilt by havin' that dispisable-lookin' thing
afore my eyes.'</p>

<p>"So I goes and pokes it away in a sly corner,
for it had tried my feelin's so I parfectly hated
the sight on't. I wa'n't much afeared that Uncle
Higgins would starve, if he didn't have the
puddin' to top off with. He was a dreadful
great eater&mdash;eat as much as two Christian men
ought to; but I guess he didn't take a terrible
sight of comfort eatin' his dinner, for he had on
an awful long face the whole time. I s'pose
that tarnal old puddin' was runnin' in his head.
If 'twa'n't in his, it was in mine.</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Keziah was mighty airnest to
know what luck I had with it. I meant to ave
told her afore dinner, and should, if Uncle Hig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>gins
hadn't come in so, all of a sudding, while I
was tryin' to settle in my mind what I should do
about puttin' it on to the table for dinner.
When she asked me about it, I had tough work
to keep from bu'stin' right out a cryin'; for I
felt sorry, and I felt 'shamed, and, to tell the
plain truth, a leetle mite put out.</p>

<p>"'Well, it does seem curious,' says she, arter
I'd finished tellin' her about it. 'Run, Tabitha,
and bring the puddin' here, and let me have a
squint at it. If I ever made one puddin' by that
resait, I'm free to say I've made a hundred,
and al'ays had first rate luck. The very witches
have got into the puddin', I b'l'eve.'</p>

<p>"So off I goes and gits the puddin', and carries
it in for Aunt Keziah to look at.</p>

<p>"'La, child,' says she, the minute she clapped
her eye on it, 'I've found out the marvellous
mystery. You've put it into the wrong pudding'-dish.'</p>

<p>"'What odds can it make,' says I, 'whether
it's in this or any other?'</p>

<p>"'Why, don't you see, child, that the dish,
by bein' so deep and so small over, don't give
the whey a chance to settle off round the edges,
but makes it all mix in with the rice? I al'ays
puts it into that shaller, Chany dish, with a gilt
edge, that you'll find on the lower shelf of the
cupboard. Now, if you'll jest shift the puddin'
into that 'ere dish, you'll see 'twill look as different
as light and darkness.'</p>

<p>"Well, off I went and put it into the dish she
told me about, when, lo and behold! the whey
settled off jest as calm and purty as a summer's
mornin', and made a streak round the outside
of the puddin' clear and bright as crystchal. I
could hardly b'l'eve my own eyes, and I s'pose
I was as tickled and proud a critter as ever
walked on the face of the airth. I carried it
right along to let Aunt Keziah see it.</p>

<p>"'There,' says she, 'that looks right; that'll
suit Mr. Higgins. Say not a word about it, Tabitha;
but jest set it into the kittle to-morrow
and heat it over with the steam, and 'twill do
for dinner; for, if you should try forty thousand
times, you wouldn't hit it righter than you have
this time.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' says I, 'if you or any other pairson
had told me that I should undergone so much
misery on account of usin' the wrong puddin'-dish,
I wouldn't 'ave b'l'eved 'em.'</p>

<p>"The next day, I steamed the puddin', put it
into the Chany dish, and sot it on the table for
dinner.</p>

<p>"'There, now, that looks somethin' like,'
says Uncle Higgins. 'I'll tell you what, Tabitha,
it isn't best for young, inexperienced gals,
like you, to be too wilful&mdash;too fond of havin'
their own way. You thought you'd tire me
out, and git me to eat one of your mushy puddin's
at last; but I must be nigh on to famishin'
afore I could eat sich a puddin' as you made
yesterday.'</p>

<p>"'I'm glad it suits you, sir,' says I, lookin'
meek and innocent as old Aunt Peggy's cosset
lamb, when it turns its basin of milk over.</p>

<p>"You've no idee how I wanted to tell him
'twas the identical puddin' he run down so to
the very lowest notch the day afore; but, you
see, I daresn't, so all the pay I could git was the
privilege of laughin' in my sleeve as he sot there
eatin' the puddin', and praisin' it every other
mouthful."</p>

<h2><a name="A_PLEASANT_LETTER" id="A_PLEASANT_LETTER"></a>A PLEASANT LETTER.</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Campbell Co.</span>, <em>Va.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L. A. Godey&mdash;Dear Sir</span>: I owe you
for my subscription to the "Lady's Book" for
1852 and 1853. I send you five dollars inclosed.
Give me such credit as you may think proper to
extend to an old subscriber of fifteen years' standing,
who sometimes pays in advance, and sometimes
don't, yet never clubs, and never fails to
pay without charge to you. I call that a pretty
strong appeal.</p>

<p>Having a moment of leisure on my hands
while addressing you on business, I am tempted
to put in a word to you extra&mdash;to you, who have
been talking to me steadily for fifteen years,
while I have never had a chance for a syllable
in reply. Indeed, I am not positively assured
that editors, however fond they may be of holding
forth before their readers, do manifest any
remarkable solicitude to have them "answer
back again." I should take it they were rather
of that class, Irishman-like, who prefer to have
"all the reciprocity on one side." I believe it
may be justly said of them, that they do not admire
any sort of correspondence that don't pay
well. It, however, seems that an old subscriber
will, once in a while, presume on long acquaintance,
and treat you as a familiar friend, with
whom he has the right to make free. I, at this
present moment, feel an impulse of this kind;
but apprehend my position may appear to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
rather gawky, and even peradventure unwarrantable.
But old men, you know, and especially
conceited ones, are garrulous.</p>

<p>By the way, Mr. Godey, are you phrenologist
enough to tell me why it is that, when all the
other faculties are growing smaller, the organ of
self-esteem is increasing in size? We hear a
great deal said about "the aggressive" and "the
progressive." Well, it appears to me that this
same organ of self-esteem deserves to bear off all
the first class premiums at the next "World's
Fair" of Active Principles, whether "aggressive"
or "progressive." I beg your pardon, my dear
sir, I had no idea of being at all personal. But
you politely intimate that "brevity is the soul
of wit." Thank you! I remark this, with
editors, is quite a favorite prescription (you see,
I naturally fall into professional figures). Nevertheless,
it is one they are not overly fond of
calling into requisition themselves. Albeit, Mr.
Godey, you and I shall not fall out here. For,
as we possess none of the corporeal parts, neither
of us has much use for "the soul." Don't
frown; I'll praise you presently.</p>

<p>I can remember, in time past, when concluding
the perusal of a number of the "Lady's
Book," I have found myself soliloquizing thus:
"Well, I have read it through, and what is in
it? Absolutely nothing that I can remember,
or, what is worse, nothing that is worth remembering.
I will discontinue. I wish Godey was
more of a utilitarian, and would give us a little
less of his whipped syllabub, and a little more
of solid food." But another year would come
in and go out, and I still remained a subscriber
to the "Lady's Book;" and, all this time, its
strides "progressive" were very humble and
moderate, indeed. But times have changed, and
the "Lady's Book" has changed with them. I
am glad to say there has been a great improvement&mdash;a
very great improvement in your magazine.
Thanks to your industrious, judicious,
and sensible editress, the ratio of the useful and
valuable is fast gaining on the trashy, "flat, and
unprofitable." Go on.</p>

<p>I, some time back, said to my daughter&mdash;only,
and motherless&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, child, I believe I must discontinue
'Godey.'"</p>

<p>"Why, pa?"</p>

<p>"It is not suited to my taste, and you are always
at school."</p>

<p>"But, pa, I always read the numbers through
when I come home. I like it very much. It is
very interesting. I prefer it to any of the magazines."</p>

<p>"There is 'Harper's'&mdash;more solid matter."</p>

<p>"I don't like 'Harper's.' I can't read it. I
greatly prefer 'Godey.' I do not know what I
should do without it. Do, pa, continue to take
it for me."</p>

<p>I saw at once you had a strong hold on her
regard, and I dropped the subject. Since then,
I observe she has got out the old numbers for
many years back (we keep them carefully filed
away), and has been very busy with them; and,
when she is done with them, she sorts them all
over nicely and puts them away again. The upshot
of the matter is this letter and the inclosure.
Trusting that none other than benign influences
will ever be derived from the pages of
your popular magazine, I subscribe myself,</p>

<p class="center">Your ob't s'v't,      W. S. G.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(<em>Underscored.</em>) P. S.&mdash;A word about underscoring.
I would thank my excellent friend,
Mrs. Hale, to give her lady contributors a gentle
hint&mdash;a very gentle one. Lady authors are
much given to underscoring; that the practice is
considered, by some of the readers of the "Lady's
Book," not to be in good taste, and far
"more honored in the breach than in the observance."
It generally is declaratory of about
this: "Reader, here is the point, which I fear
you have not penetration to perceive;" or,
"How funny that is!" or, "What a nice thought
is here!" or, "How smart and striking this!" or
the like. Now, I would respectfully suggest
that the better way is to write nothing that does
not deserve to be underscored, as might be exemplified,
if my modesty did not forbid, in the
preceding delectable epistle. If a writer deems
a composition to be superlatively fine, as authors
not unfrequently do, just recommend that the
word "underscored" be written at the top, as I
have done at the top of this postscript, with the
assurance that the editor will put that in type,
too, and then the thing will be fixed. For
really some readers do not think it polite in
authors to be everlastingly reminding them that
"Here is a beautiful idea, which I fear you are
too obtuse to discover." We poor readers would
be gratified by finding we had a little credit for
common sense. Any way, for one, I prefer to
emphasize for myself. Now, I have not the
same prejudice or objection, whichever you
choose to call it, to capitals. They may be often
used with fine effect. As, for instance, in the
preface to D'Aubigne's "History of the Reformation,"
where the author states his principle
to be that there is a "GOD IN HISTORY." I
am pleased to see that some of your best contributors
have no use at all for the underscore.</p>

<h2><a name="INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_MAKING_ORNAMENTS_IN_RICE" id="INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_MAKING_ORNAMENTS_IN_RICE"></a>INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING ORNAMENTS IN
RICE SHELL-WORK.</h2>


<p>In our January number we described the
whole process of preparing the shells, and making
all those separate portions necessary to
form a wreath; the same instructions apply
equally to the present branch of our subject;
but then we only spoke of the "simple" form
of this work, or that composed merely of shells
and silver wire. It is doubtless the most chaste,
from its extreme purity; but it is also the most
perishable, for we all know how quickly silver
tarnishes; it likewise is not so convenient for
wear, especially in the hair, for, be as careful
as ever we will, we cannot entirely avoid
roughness and projecting points.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_154a.jpg" width="282" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SPRAYS IN RICE SHELL-WORK.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_154abig.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>The "composite form," which we are now
about to describe, admits of the ornaments
being made to match, or contrast with, or set
off, any hue of dress or complexion. In the
making of composite rice shell-wreaths, &amp;c.,
various materials are brought into use, as floss-silk;
fine wire-chenil; Roman-pearl beads, and
beads of a similar kind of coral color, turquoise,
pink, green, or yellow; flower-seeds; velvet or
satin, or silver leaves; and silver bullion.</p>

<p>To make a wreath, and a set of sprays for a
bridal-dress, we should use white floss-silk,
white chenil, and silver bullion. The shells are
to be "wired," as directed in our former article;
but, in making them up into leaves and flowers,
instead of using the fine wire, we use the floss-silk
to wind or bind them; and thus, instead of
the wires being all exposed, they are hidden, and
the stems present a smooth silken surface.</p>

<p>For making a simple, or single flower, we use
the five shells as before, but we cut half an inch
of silver bullion, thread it on one of the cut
lengths of wire (of which we directed there
should always be a supply), fold it into a loop,
twist the wire to keep the bullion firmly in form
and place, and put this in the centre of the
flower, arranging the five shells round it, and
binding the stem with the silk.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 148px;">
<img src="images/i_154b.jpg" width="148" height="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>DOUBLE FLOWER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In making the "double flower," we use twenty instead of the
seventeen shells before directed; viz. five for the flower, and fifteen
for the five leaflets of three shells each; in the centre of the five
shells we put the loop of bullion just described, and between the
flower and the leaflets we arrange five loops of fine wire-chenil at
equal distances, as in this cut, allowing each loop to project nearly
half an inch, and binding them on with the fine wire; the leaflets
are then arranged round the stem so that the centre shell of each one
appears between, and just beyond each two loops; the whole is bound
together with silk, and the stem covered to its extremity. The "bud"
may either have a loop of chenil standing up on each side of the shells
of which it is composed, or it may be formed solely of two or three
loops of chenil bound on to a stem of wire with floss-silk. When the
flowers are colored, by adding chenil and beads, or seeds to them,
green leaves and green buds have a very pretty effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The leaves for the bridal ornaments we were
speaking of, may either be composed of shells
and wound with white silk or silver, or white
satin or velvet, or crêpe leaves may be used. We
need scarcely add that silk must be used to bind
all the parts together.</p>

<p>Let us imagine, now, that a <em>brunette</em> desires
to dress her hair, and decorate her snowy ball-dress
with wreaths, and sprays, &amp;c., of scarlet or
coral color.</p>

<p>The shells must be prepared, and wired in the
ordinary way, and half a dozen reels of floss-silk,
and a knot of chenil of the desired hue, and
four strings of small coral-colored beads, and
two of beads about the average size of peas, got.
These beads must each be threaded separately
like the shells, but on rather shorter lengths of
wire, and the wire folded and twisted to make it
hold its beads firmly. One of the larger beads
should be put in the centre of every double
flower, and three of the small ones in the centre
of every single flower. The flowers may be
made simply with the five shells and five loops
of chenil, omitting the leaflets. If the leaves
are to be made of shells, the stems must be bound
with this colored silk; but velvet, or satin, or tinsel
leaves of the same hue may be substituted for
or intermixed with the shell leaves with good
effect.</p>

<p>Ornaments for blue, pink, green, or maize
<em>toilettes</em> may in like manner be formed <em>en suite</em>
by substituting beads, silk, and chenil, of the
chosen shade, for the color we have given.
Mourning-wreaths, &amp;c., may likewise be made
by using black silk, chenil, and beads; or gray
silk and chenil with pearl beads, and gray or
white satin leaves.</p>

<p>When once our readers have begun to carry
our directions into practice, they will perceive
how possible it is to create an infinite variety
of tasteful articles, all differing in style, form,
and hue. Coronets, wreaths, and headdresses
of every conceivable pattern may be made; sprays
for the dress of any size, length, or shape; bouquets
for the waist or bosom; trimmings for the
<em>corsage</em>; tiny wreaths to put between quilled
ribbon or <em>blonde</em> for the purpose of ornamenting
gloves, or sleeves, or the top of the dress; flowers
for caps; studs or buttons for the front of
a dress; in short, more things than we have
time or space to name. And all these may be
made very economically, for less than one-third
of the ordinary cost of such decorations.</p>

<p>We have given, at the commencement of this
article, a cut of a spray, or rather of a portion
of one, for want of space compelled us to shorten
it; it has green velvet leaves; the flowers are
surrounded by chenil loops, and have in their
centres flower-seeds; it is wound with silk.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BOUQUET IN RICE SHELL-WORK.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_155big.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>This cut represents a small bouquet to be worn
brooch-fashion in the bosom of the dress; it is
composed of shells and turquoise beads, and
wound with light blue silk. The leaves are of
shells, and gradually increase in size towards the
end of it.</p>

<p>The advantage of using silk instead of the
fine silver wire for binding the stems, &amp;c., is,
that not only are all points and inequalities thus
smoothed over, but, with ordinary care, the
articles wear much longer&mdash;for even if the
small portions of silver wire left exposed do tarnish,
they cannot mar the beauty of the whole,
forming then so very trifling a portion of it, instead
of the leading feature, as they do in "simple
rice shell-work."</p>

<p>We said just now that studs or buttons could
be formed with shells; we will now explain how
this may be done.</p>

<p>Cut out a set of circular pieces of white cartridge-paper,
or very thin card-board of the size
it is wished the buttons should be; from the
diameter of a dollar to that of a twenty-five cent
piece is the ordinary scale. Have ready wired
some middle-sized and small shells, and a pearl
or colored bead the size of a pea for each button.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>With a good-sized pin perforate a circle of
holes, about a third of an inch in, all the way
round, and pass the wire of a middle-sized shell
through each, bending the shells down, so that
they lie evenly round with their backs upwards,
and their points projecting just beyond the edge
of the card-board. Without disturbing the wires
on the wrong side, now make another circle of
perforated holes, and put in another round of
shells, bending them so as just to overlap the
outer ones. Still leave the ends of wire, and pierce
a third circle of holes, and into these put small
shells, and bend them in like manner, to fit on
the former rounds. Three circles will generally
be sufficient for a good-sized button. Pierce a
hole in the centre, and put in the wired bead,
which will fill up and complete the surface.
Now carefully flatten down the wires at the
back, and cover the back with silk, arranging
any shell which may have become misplaced
afterwards.</p>

<p>The floss-silk may be obtained at any large
Berlin wool shop; it is sold on small reels, of
which from two to six or eight will be required,
according to the quantity of work which has
to be wound.</p>

<p>The chenil is procurable at the same place;
one knot goes a great way. It is the small wired
chenil we use, not the fine embroidery chenil.</p>

<p>The beads are sold at most fancy repositories.
It is not the crystal glass, or the seed bead which
we use, but those French colored glass beads
that have lately been so much worn. It is not
absolutely necessary they be only round; for
there is a long, or rather an oblong variety,
which is very effective.</p>

<p>The leaves and flower-seeds may be bought at
any artificial florist's; but the best way is to obtain
them from the makers, then they can be
ordered of any color or pattern.</p>

<p>A circular wreath of simple daisy-flowers, like
the third flower cut given in our last article, has
very chaste and graceful appearance; or these
flowers may be combined with the wheat-ears
with good effect.</p>

<p>But we have said enough to open the path to
our readers; and once entered therein, they will
find the work infinitely suggestive, and offering
scope for every graceful and tasteful vagary. So
we will only add a little word of advice&mdash;aim at
lightness, not only of appearance, but of actual
weight, and never crowd or load any ornament
with too much work. The leading principle of
artistic excellence in every department of art is
simplicity; and this may be attained by close
and severe attention. The eye is most pleased
when it can retain at a glance the chief points
of attraction.</p>

<p>In our third article, we shall give instructions
for making baskets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the western counties, the children, decked
with the wreaths and true-lover's knots presented
to them, gayly adorn one of their number as
their chief, and march from house to house,
singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">

<p>They commence in many places as early as
six o'clock in the morning, and intermingle the
cry, "To-morrow is come!" Afterwards they
make merry with their collections. At Islip,

sing the following, when collecting pence on this
day&mdash;</p>

<p>The mission of Valentines is one of the very
few old customs not on the wane; and the streets
of our metropolis practically bear evidence of
this fact in the distribution of love-messages on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
our stalls and shop-windows, varying in price
from a sovereign to one halfpenny. Our readers,
no doubt, will ask for its origin, and there
we are at fault to begin with. The events of
St. Valentine's life furnish no clue whatever to
the mystery, although Wheatley, in his "Illustration
of the Common Prayer," absurdly disposes
of the question in this way: "St. Valentine
was a man of most admirable parts, and so
famous for his love and charity, that the custom
of choosing Valentines upon his festival, which
is still practised, took its rise from thence." We
see no explanation here in any way satisfactory,
and must be contented with the hope that some
of our antiquaries may hit on something more to
the purpose.</p>

<p>It was anciently the custom to draw lots on
this day. The names of an equal number of
each sex were put into a box, in separate partitions,
out of which every one present drew a
name, called the Valentine, which was regarded
as a good omen of their future marriage. It
would appear from a curious passage quoted in
the "Dictionary of Archaisms," that any lover
was hence termed a Valentine; not necessarily
an affianced lover, as suggested in "Hampson's
Calendarium," vol. i. p. 163. Lydgate, the
poet of Bury, in the fifteenth century, thus mentions
this practice&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"St. Valentine, of custom year by year</div>
  <div class="i1">Men have an usance in this region</div>
  <div class="i0">To look and search Cupid's calendere,</div>
  <div class="i1">And choose their choice by great affection:</div>
  <div class="i1">Such as be prick'd with Cupid's motion,</div>
  <div class="i0">Taking their choice as their lot doth fall:</div>
  <div class="i0">But I love one which excelleth all."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The divinations practised on Valentine's day
are a curious subject. Herrick mentions one by
rose-buds&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"She must no more a-Maying;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or by rose-buds divine</div>
  <div class="i0">Who'll be her Valentine."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the poet may here allude to a practice
similar to the following, quoted by Brand: "Last
Friday was Valentine day; and the night before
I got five bay-leaves, and pinned four of them
to the four corners of my pillow, and the fifth
to the middle; and then, if I dreamt of my
sweetheart, Betty said we should be married
before the year was out. <em>But, to make it more
sure</em>, I boiled an egg hard, and took out the
yolk, and filled it with salt; and, when I went
to bed, eat it shell and all, without speaking or
drinking after it. We also wrote our lover's
names upon bits of paper, and rolled them up in
clay, and put them into water; and the first
that rose up was to be our Valentine. Would
you think it? Mr. Blossom was my man. I
lay abed, and shut my eyes all the morning, till
he came to our house, for I would not have seen
another man before him for all the world."
According to Mother Bunch, the following lines
should be said by the girl on retiring to rest the
previous night&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Sweet guardian angels, let me have</div>
  <div class="i0">What I most earnestly do crave,</div>
  <div class="i0">A Valentine endowed with love,</div>
  <div class="i0">That will both kind and constant prove."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We believe the old custom of drawing lots on
this eventful day is obsolete, and has given place
to the favorite practice of sending pictures, with
poetical legends, to objects of love or ridicule.
The lower classes, however, seldom treat the
matter with levity, and many are the offers of
marriage thus made. The clerks at the post-offices
are to be pitied, the immense increase of
letters beyond the usual average adding very inconveniently
to their labors. Such is Mr. Halliwell's
account of Valentine's day.</p>

<p>In "Poor Robin's Almanack," 1676, the
<em>drawing</em> of Valentines is thus alluded to&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Now, Andrew, Antho-</div>
  <div class="i1">Ny, and William,</div>
  <div class="i0">For Valentines <em>draw</em></div>
  <div class="i1">Prue, Kate, Jilian."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many curious customs are related by different
writers in honor of this day; but, of all the
quotations that could be made, none is more
quaint and striking than the following from the
Diary of the celebrated Pepys. On the 14th of
February, 1667, is there entered: "This morning
came up to my wife's bedside, I being up
dressing myself, little Will Mercer to her Valentine,
and brought her name written upon blue
paper in gold letters, done by myself very pretty;
and we were both well pleased with it. But I
am also this year my wife's Valentine, and it
will cost me £5; but that I must have laid out,
if we had not been Valentines." He also adds:
"I find that Mrs. Pierce's little girl is my Valentine,
she having drawn me; which I was not
sorry for, easing me of something more than I
must have given to others. But here I do first
observe the drawing of mottoes as well as names;
so that Pierce, who drew my wife, did draw also
a motto, and this girl drew another for me:
what mine was I forget; but my wife's was most
courteous, and most fair, which, as it may be
used on an anagram upon each name, might be
very pretty. One wonder I observed to-day,
there was no music in the morning, to call up
our new married friend (Peg Penn), which is
very mean, methinks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>That Valentines were not confined to the
lower classes in the days of Pepys, and were
sometimes of a very costly description, may be
judged from the following statement: "The
Duke of York being once Mrs. Stuart's Valentine,
did give her a jewel of about £800, and my
Lord Mandeville, her Valentine this year, a
ring of about £300."</p>

<p>And, in the following year, he notes down:
"This evening my wife did with great pleasure
show me her stock of jewels, increased by the
ring she hath made lately, as my Valentine's
gift this year, a Turkey stone set with diamonds;
with this, and what she had, she reckons
that she hath above £150 worth of jewels of one
kind or other, and I am glad of it; for it is fit
the wretch should have something to content
herself with."</p>

<p>With regard to the origin of this festival in
the calendar, there are many conflicting opinions.
St. Valentine, who suffered martyrdom in the
reign of the Emperor Claudius, was eminently
distinguished for his love and charity; and the
custom of choosing Valentines, or special loving
friends on this day, is by some supposed to have
thence originated. The following solution is,
however, the more probable one. It was the
practice in ancient Rome, during a great part of
the month of February, to celebrate the Lupercalia,
which were feasts in honor of Pan and
Juno, whence the latter deity was named Februata,
or Februalis. On this occasion, amidst a
variety of ceremonies, the names of young women
were put into a box, from which they were
drawn by the men, as chance directed. The
pastors of the early Christian church, who by
every possible means endeavored to eradicate
the vestiges of pagan superstitions, and chiefly
by some commutations of their forms, substituted,
in the present instance, the names of particular
saints, instead of those of the women;
and, as the festival of the Lupercalia had commenced
about the middle of February, they appear
to have chosen Valentine's day for celebrating
the new feast, because it occurred nearly
at the same time.</p>

<p>"<em>I feel as if I should fly!</em>"</p>

<p>No wonder poor Mrs. Bunker longed for the
wings of a dove, if they could bear her to anything
like rest. It was Monday&mdash;washing-day&mdash;and
<em>blue</em> Monday into the bargain. The parlor
was in disorder (the Bunkers always sat in
their parlor on Sunday, and held it sacred the
rest of the week); the front hall tracked and
littered up with the arrival of a visitor's baggage&mdash;the
spare room was not ready&mdash;the clothes
not counted out&mdash;the girl idling away her time
at the pump&mdash;the breakfast dishes unwashed&mdash;and
the baby screaming, as only a cross child
can scream, in its mother's arms, showing not
the least symptom of a morning nap, or, indeed,
of <em>anything</em> but colic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker, as she sat in the midst of this
confusion, and expressed her desire to fly, bore
no resemblance whatever to an angel&mdash;except
that angels are usually represented with loose
robes and unconfined hair. We question if she
had looked at a brush since the day before, and
her morning-dress was of the style denominated
"wrapper"&mdash;a not over-clean chintz. The
room itself was cheerful enough, so far as sunshine
and comfortable furniture would go; but
nothing was in its place; and this disorder, added
to the forlorn appearance of Mrs. Bunker, holding
the baby in its sour, crumpled night-dress
and soiled flannel, was anything but an inviting
prospect to a newly arrived guest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker expected her every minute&mdash;Aunt
Lovey&mdash;her husband's aunt, who had
brought him up, and had given him all those
particular ways that were the bane of Mrs.
Bunker's wedded life, she having very little
idea of the necessity he attached to method in
managing a household. Mrs. Bunker, only two
years from school, had written very nice letters
to this friend of her husband's orphaned childhood.
She loved her Joshua, in spite of his
unsentimental name, and was inclined to adopt
all his family in her affectionate little soul. Nor
was it unnatural that she wished them to think
well of her in return; she particularly desired
to gain Aunt Lovey's good opinion, and when
the long talked of visit was decided on, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
hoped to make a grand first impression. If it
hadn't been Monday morning, and if baby
hadn't been so cross&mdash;if the spare room had only
been cleared up after her brother's departure&mdash;if
the girl was "worth two straws"&mdash;in fact, if
everything hadn't been exactly what it shouldn't
be, Mrs. Bunker would have got up herself, her
house, and her baby, to the best advantage. She
had a very pretty face and figure, a fact of which
she was well aware, and as a school-girl and
young lady in society, had made the most of.
Since her marriage, this was not so apparent to
Mr. Bunker, however, as in the days of their
courtship. <em>Then</em>, she never allowed herself to
be seen without her hair in the most wonderful
French twists and Grecian braids&mdash;or her dress
put on to the utmost advantage. Now, "it
wasn't worth while to dress just for Joshua"&mdash;or
"baby was <em>so</em> troublesome"&mdash;or "she hadn't
a thing to put on." It <em>was</em> worth while to dress
for Aunt Lovey, and she desired to look her very
best&mdash;only baby <em>wouldn't</em> go to sleep. "Rock-a-by
baby"&mdash;</p>

<p>(Mrs. Bunker had been considered to have
the best voice in the Highville Seminary, but
now her music was confined chiefly to that
charming ballad writer, Mother Goose.)</p>

<p>"Rock-a-by baby, father's gone a hunting"&mdash;Oh,
dear, she will be here before I can get him
down! There&mdash;therey&mdash;did the drayman say his
Aunty Lovey was a-goin' to walky uppy to the
housey? Johnny shall ride, Johnny shall ride
(you provoking little monkey, why <em>don't</em> you
shut your eyes!)&mdash;"Wid a white pussy-cat tied
to his side!"&mdash;sang, and rocked, and trotted Mrs.
Bunker.</p>

<p>"Where <em>is</em> that Jane? Not a dish washed&mdash;and
I don't believe the hot water's on for the
clothes. Therey, therey, mother's baby, mother's
only little man! Did the naughty colic bother
mother's little son? Send the wind right up, so
I would. Ride a cock horse to Banbury cross&mdash;therey,
therey, don't cry so, mother's little man&mdash;'Had
a little dog, sir, Banger was his name, sir'&mdash;Banger,
Buffer, Kicker, Cuffer, <em>Banger</em> was
his name, sir! Jane! Jane! Where is that
girl? I feel as if I should fly!"</p>

<p>At which remark&mdash;the energy of which we
have endeavored to portray in the most crumpled
italics&mdash;the door opened to admit, not Jane, but
Aunt Lovey, and our history of Mrs. Bunker's
tribulations began.</p>

<p>She gave one glance at her visitor, one to
herself, and round the room. There was no
help for it&mdash;she was obliged to deposit baby in
the cradle, screaming as he was, and advance to
make a "first impression." Aunt Lovey did
not look shocked or disgusted&mdash;a little surprised
certainly, for, knowing her nephew's orderly
propensities, this was not what she expected to
find his home, and the untidy, tired, fretted-looking
woman who introduced herself as his
wife, did not certainly answer to the lover's
descriptions of his betrothed. However, she
had been a housekeeper, and knew what Monday
mornings were, with only one maid of all
work, and a young child to see to. So she kissed
her niece very cordially for the warm welcome
she offered, and begging 'not to be minded, as
she understood these little troubles,' sat down,
laid aside her bonnet and shawl, and asked for
the baby.</p>

<p>There it was again&mdash;hardest of all! Mrs.
Bunker's personal vanity, in departing from her
as a married woman, had rested and centred itself
on the baby. Aunt Lovey had taken the
utmost interest in its advent&mdash;knitted all its
socks, the very blue pair, soiled and dirty, which
he was kicking out at that moment&mdash;and in
return, had been favored by rapturous accounts
of his <em>beauty</em> at three days old, his knowingness
at three months. Mrs. Bunker had pictured
herself presenting the baby in grand toilet to his
great-aunt, and seeing her surprise, as the old
lady confessed the half had not been told her&mdash;"oh,
dear!"</p>

<p>But there was no help for it, and she was
obliged to withdraw the poor little juvenile from
its involuntary confinement, ready to cry with
weariness and disappointment, as she tried to
coax it into something like good-humor. Jane,
drawn by curiosity where duty failed, arrived to
complete the tableau, slamming the door, and
slopping over the pump-water on her way to
the wash-kitchen. She must have been experimenting
on the principle that "the longest way
round is the shortest way home," for there was a
door in the work-kitchen leading directly to the
street.</p>

<p>Good Aunt Lovey was no more discomposed
by the bold stare the "help" fixed upon her, than
she had been by the rest of the picture. It must
have cost her an inward tremor to lay down her
dove-colored cashmere shawl and split straw bonnet
with its white satin ribbons, on the littered
bureau, but she did so without invitation, Mrs.
Bunker having fairly forgotten to offer one in
the combined annoyances and embarrassments
of the moment, and then, seated in the rocking-chair,
from which her niece had risen, she spread
the cradle blanket in her lap, and held out her
hands for the baby.</p>

<p>It was really a very nice child, as babies go,
in spite of its rumpled costume. Aunt Lovey's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
first proceeding was to "straighten it out,"
smoothing the uncomfortable folds of cloth and
flannel from under its back, and thus covering
its cold little feet. Her handkerchief was produced
to dry the little face from the mingled
effects of tears and teething, and then warmed
on the stove&mdash;there was very little fire&mdash;the
stove never <em>did</em> draw on washing-day&mdash;to cover
the mottled arms and hands. Baby thus smoothed,
soothed, and comforted, presented a much more
respectable appearance, and received a hearty
kiss from its grand-aunt, by way of an anodyne.
It seemed to have the desired effect, for, after
staring with its round blue eyes in the old lady's
face, as if endeavoring to recall the features, it
gradually winked and blinked itself to sleep, certainly
contrary to its most determined intentions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker, who had excused herself as if
to overlook Jane's operations, but in reality to
take up the crying fit where the baby left off,
returned, with eyes very much swollen in consequence,
and tried to offer an apology for herself
and her house, but broke down again into
a little sob, and a clean pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear, no excuse is needed,"
hummed Aunt Lovey, at the mother and the fast
retiring baby, to the old-fashioned melody of
"Banks and braes." "Just warm a pillow&mdash;there,
that's right; now shake it up, and make it soft;
have every feather smooth and light," unconsciously
relapsing into rhyme as well as chime,
while she deposited the placid Johnny in his accustomed
bed. "And now, my dear, I see how
it all is. Could you lend me a clean check apron?&mdash;never
mind, this towel will do, and will wash
up these dishes post haste. What's your girl's
name? Jane? Jane, here, come and rake up
this fire a little; there's nothing helps matters
along faster than a bright, cheerful fire; it's like
a lively disposition, which I'm sure you have
naturally."</p>

<p>It was wonderful to see Jane's alacrity in
obeying these instructions, given in a quick,
inspiriting, and, at the same time, not-to-be-trifled-with
tone. Mrs. Bunker, captain as she
was, placed herself willingly under the orders
of so skilful a pilot, and was steered triumphantly
through the household difficulties that had
gathered so thickly around her.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear," resumed that excellent
woman, unpinning the towel that encircled her
ample waist, and folding it smoothly before she
laid it down, "what else is there to do this
morning?"</p>

<p>The fire was burning cheerfully, the dishes
put away, the carpet swept, the chairs set back,
and the baby still sleeping soundly in the bright
warmth that had diffused itself throughout the
room. Mrs. Bunker already felt as if she had
known Aunt Lovey for a long time; they had
talked all the while they were busied about
household affairs, and the new niece felt as if she
could almost open her heart to the kind old lady,
and consult her about those constantly occurring
domestic drawbacks and trials. Joshua, good
husband as he was, did not seem to understand.
It was more effective than a week of formal
visiting, and Mrs. Bunker's face and step brightened
with the room. Now came the clouds
again. "There was so much to be done, she
didn't know where to begin."</p>

<p>"But what is it?" urged Aunt Lovey, stooping
down admiringly over the cradle, for the
baby looked very lovely in his quiet sleep, one
little round hand pushed under his cheek&mdash;he
was making as good an impression as his mother
could desire.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>everything</em>!" responded the baby's mother,
in a despairing tone.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see, <em>mustard to mix</em>," and with these
cabalistic words, the visitor took a deliberate
survey of her hostess for the first time. "Consider
me your grandmother, Sophia, and let me
advise you to tidy yourself a little; that will be
the first step towards it. A neat morning-dress
and clean apron are next best, or perhaps better,
than a good fire, in any house. I'll see to the
baby."</p>

<p>Aunt Lucy certainly made herself at home.
She put the tips of her prunella buskins on the
stove hearth, and examined the hem of her skirts
to see if they had contracted any dampness or
mud stains in her recent walk, and then produced
her knitting, as if she was settled down
for some time. Mrs. Bunker took the advice,
as she had former prescriptions, and found it to
work as well. The morning's duties were accomplished
with an ease and alacrity that astonished
herself, even to making the great chamber
as neat as Aunt Lovey's heart could desire,
without the mortification of her knowing it had
ever been otherwise.</p>

<p>It was not until Mr. Bunker had come from
the store, and been duly astonished and delighted
at his aunt's unexpected arrival, and the tidy
appearance of the whole household&mdash;to tell the
truth, he wondered how the last happened to
be so&mdash;that Mrs. Bunker found time to seek an
explanation of the significant sentence applied
by the old lady to her state of despondency with
regard to domestic affairs. Significant she was
convinced, though she could not exactly make
out the application, as her aunt had seen the
mutton chops destined for dinner arrive from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the butcher's, and she had never heard of mustard
being taken with them. They had been duly
served, praised, and eaten; the dinner dishes
were washed and put away, so was the baby for
his second diurnal nap, and Mrs. Bunker, notwithstanding
she had company, found herself
seated to her sewing by three o'clock for the
first in a month, while Jane, like the unfortunate
"maid" mentioned in one of the baby's
favorite lullabies, was</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"In the garden</div>
  <div class="i0">Hanging out the clothes."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aunt Lovey, looking thoughtfully over her
spectacles, thought her nephew's description of
his wife not so far out of the way after all, as
she hemmed away industriously at a pile of new
towels, the most fascinating work next to crochet
one can undertake; it slips by so fast and evenly,
and there seems to be so much accomplished.</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Lovey," said Mrs. Bunker, looking
up suddenly, and finding those penetrating
gray eyes fixed on her, "what did you mean by
'mustard to mix?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not explain, did I? Well, when
I was first married and moved out west&mdash;Utica
was out west then, from Connecticut&mdash;I knew
no more about managing for myself than you
do now. I used to find my work accumulate,
and I would get discouraged and go about a
whole week, feeling as if the world rested upon
my shoulders; and that made me mope, and
your uncle John got discouraged, because I did,
and there was no end of the snarl things would
get into. Our only near neighbor was a nice
tidy body, who always looked like wax-work."</p>

<p>"Something such a person as you," interrupted
Mrs. Bunker, playfully.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps so; but you never saw my
house; her house was like a pin from one end to
the other. One day I just ran in to borrow a
little meal&mdash;ours had given out unexpectedly&mdash;and
I found my good neighbor in a flurry, acting
just as I used to feel sometimes."</p>

<p>"'Oh, she had <em>everything</em> to do,' she said,
'and company coming to dinner.'</p>

<p>"'Everything? Well, what? As far as I
could see, everything was done.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, the table's to set;' and up and around
the room she went again.</p>

<p>"'But it was two hours to dinner&mdash;what
else?'</p>

<p>"'Why!&mdash;well, then, <em>mustard to mix</em>!'</p>

<p>"That was every earthly thing, come to think
of it; but she had been flurried by the sudden
arrival, and did not stop to see that it could not
possibly disturb any of her arrangements. So I
went home, and found I generally had <em>mustard
to mix</em>, when my flurries came on; that is, if I
set myself right to work to clear up the snarl,
it wasn't half so bad as I felt it was. Setting
down to fret over matters only snarled things
the more, and then poor John was troubled to
see me worried, and things would go from bad
to worse."</p>

<p>"But, aunty," said the young wife, with a
half sigh, ending in a smile, "do you think
I shall <em>ever</em> make a housekeeper? I know
Joshua is disappointed."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my dear; why not? Only you will
have to learn how to <em>mix mustard</em> to begin
with."</p>

<h2><a name="INSTANTANEOUS_FLOWERING_OF" id="INSTANTANEOUS_FLOWERING_OF"></a>INSTANTANEOUS FLOWERING OF
PLANTS.</h2>


<p>M. Herbert, a gentleman who has recently
arrived from France, on Saturday exhibited to
a few ladies and gentlemen his method of
causing plants to blow almost instantaneously.
The plants selected&mdash;a group of geraniums and
a rose-tree&mdash;were planted in two rather deep
boxes of garden mould, previously prepared with
some chemical manure, and were then covered
with glass shades. M. Herbert next proceeded
to pour over the roots, from a small watering-pot,
a chemical mixture, which, uniting with the
ingredients already in the earth, caused a great
heat, as was shown by an intense steam or vapor,
which was evolved within the shades, and allowed
to some extent to escape through a small
hole in the top, which at first was kept closed.
The effect upon the geraniums was certainly
almost instantaneous, the buds beginning to
burst in about five or six minutes, and the plants
being in full bloom within ten minutes, when
the blossoms were gathered by M. Herbert and
distributed amongst the ladies present. With
the rose-tree the exhibitor was less fortunate,
M. Herbert explaining that it had only been in
his possession about half or three-quarters of
an hour, and he had therefore not had sufficient
time to prepare for the experiment, thereby
evincing that it occupies more time than would
appear to the casual observer to be the case.
The invention may prove useful where ladies
require to decorate their drawing-rooms or boudoirs
with the beauties of Flora somewhat earlier
in the seasons than can otherwise be obtained.
The experiments took place at the residence of
M. Laurent, Onslow-house, Brompton. [How
far does this account for the Chinese "magical"
method?]</p>

  <div class="i0">Round the door it ever lingers,</div>
  <div class="i1">Calling mortal aid in vain,</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Love I well to hear it wailing,</div>
  <div class="i1">And I listen, pensively;</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Ah! she loved Lord Ronald truly;</div>
  <div class="i1">She was young and sweetly fair;</div>
  <div class="i0">Loved&mdash;and we were all forgotten&mdash;</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And I marked her, mother dearest,</div>
  <div class="i1">When was said the soft "good-night,"</div>
  <div class="i0">How her cheek so sadly faded&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">Faded to a marble white.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">To her door I followed gently,</div>
  <div class="i1">Raised the latch, and in I went,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the thoughts that so oppressed me</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Jessie, Jessie," murmured Edna,</div>

  <div class="i0">Spoke I not. My heart was breaking</div>
  <div class="i1">'Neath some vague, uncertain woe;</div>

  <div class="i0">When from out that sleep, awaking,</div>
  <div class="i1">I upon her pillow lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through the half-divided curtain</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then we missed her. Oh, my mother,</div>

  <div class="i0">Listen listen! on the night-blast</div>
  <div class="i1">Heard you not a well-known tone?</div>

  <div class="i0">There are feet upon the threshold!</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Oh, forgive me! Oh, forgive me!"</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus my sister Edna prayed&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Oh, forgive me!" "Edna! Edna!"</div>
  <div class="i1">That was all my mother said.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But she oped her arms unto her,</div>
  <div class="i1">Drew her upward to her breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in fair and tearful beauty</div>
  <div class="i1">Bowed that gentle head to rest.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Well I loved Lord Ronald, mother,</div>
  <div class="i1">Ay, far better than my life;</div>
  <div class="i0">Home I come to thee," said Edna,</div>
  <div class="i1">"Proudly his acknowledged <em>wife</em>.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Cared he not for rank or station,</div>

  <div class="i0">Turned we then. He stood beside us,</div>
  <div class="i1">Bending low with manly grace,</div>
  <div class="i0">With his soul's true love for Edna</div>

  <div class="i0">Oh! remember the poor, said a sad little voice,</div>

<h2><a name="DECORATED_PARLOR_WINDOWS" id="DECORATED_PARLOR_WINDOWS"></a>DECORATED PARLOR WINDOWS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>See Plate.</em>)</p>


<p>Our readers will notice that the models for
parlor window drapery are, as usual, furnished by
Mr. W. H. Carryl, who is rare authority in such
matters. Draperies arranged by him are shutting
out the cold air from northern firesides, and excluding
the already fervent glow of a southern
sun. His constantly increasing, establishment is
filled with busy workmen; and the choicest materials
that are manufactured abroad, whether
in silk or lace, are to be found among his importations.
Among the public calls upon his
taste and skill, we notice particularly the fitting
up of the La Pierre House, the new and model
Philadelphia hotel; and, still more recently, the
draperies of the State House at Harrisburg.</p>

<p>The La Pierre is situated on Broad, our finest
street, and was opened to the public the past
October. It is not one of the mammoth toy-shops
now so much the rage, where everything
is too fine to use, and comfort is swallowed up
in carving and gilding. Comfort is, in fact, the
distinguishing characteristic of the La Pierre, the
rooms being of an inhabitable size, and furnished
with united neatness and elegance, giving the
traveller a cheerful welcome and a homelike
feeling. To this the draperies of Mr. Carryl,
which are found all through the house, even in
the fifth story, contribute; for it is now an undisputed
axiom in decorating, that nothing goes
so far as curtains in furnishing a room. On the
principal floor, we find the drawing-room windows
draped with crimson, garnet, and gold brocatelle,
finished by heavy cornices and the richest
corresponding decorations, as will be seen in Fig.
1. which is nearly identical with the style. Of
course, there are exquisite lace curtains, as in the
plate, falling below. The reading and sitting-rooms,
appropriated to the gentlemen, are made
cheerful by crimson brocatelle draperies, while
the tea-room is distinguished by the heavy green
lambrequins, with their rich bullion fringe. It
would take a practised eye to detect it from gold
bullion, so perfect is the imitation. The effect,
especially in the evening, is precisely the same.
In the elegant suite of parlors on the second
floor, Mr. Carryl has placed curtains of brocatelle,
crimson, yellow, and green and gold, equally
rich and suited to the style of the apartments,
as in the drawing-room below (see Fig. 2);
while throughout the bed-chambers, many entire
suites, curtains of Paris stripe, in <em>satin laine</em>,
give the cheerful aspect we at first noticed.</p>

<p>The bridal chamber&mdash;that modern abomination
to good taste and common sense, yet demanded
by the fashion of hotels&mdash;is, of course,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of the whole house. Mr. Carryl
has chosen "celestial <em>rosy</em> red, love's proper
hue," instead of the pure white of the St. Nicholas,
or the staring yellow of the Metropolitan,
for the draperies of the apartment. A <em>rose</em> red,
be it understood, of the most delicate shade,
softened still more by the pure transparency of
the lace embroideries falling from the rich canopy
above the bed, or shrouding the broad arch
that divides the two apartments&mdash;a triumphal
arch to Mr. Carryl's decorative art. The whole
house is decorated in good keeping with the
already far-famed character of this luxurious
hotel, which may be justly regarded as one of
the most fashionable and distinguished in the
United States.</p>

<p>The State House at Harrisburg is fitted from
drawings made expressly for it, in a style now
become classic in public buildings. The deep
crimson India damask of our grandmothers'
times, lined with white India silk&mdash;the most
judicious choice, as it never grows yellow by
age&mdash;is disposed in full folds above the Speaker's
chair; and from these, which take the place of
a lambrequin in a modern curtain, falls a similar
heavy drapery to the floor. The whole is surmounted
by a superbly carved eagle in gilt, with
expanded wings, done expressly for Mr. Carryl
from a life model. The curtains of the windows
are to be in the same rich and simple style, and
the clock has also a decorative drapery. The
whole is arranged with a classic taste far more
appropriate to the hall than modern French
fripperies, and will add much to Mr. Carryl's
rapidly growing celebrity in this branch of domestic
art. Mr. Carryl has also furnished the
State House at Austin, Texas, with rich brocatelle
hangings, diversified with emblems and
mottoes of the Southern State of the Gulf, all
finished in superb style.</p>

<p>Through the very extensive establishment of
Mr. Carryl, No. 169 Chestnut Street, our Southern
and Western merchants can conveniently
fill their orders for curtains and trimmings, gilt
ornaments, &amp;c., being sure to get the newest
styles and the best qualities. The height from
<em>floor</em> to top of <em>window-frame</em>, and width of frame
at the top, should always accompany an order.</p>

skirt is set in box plaits upon the yoke in the
back; it is plain in front. The yoke is deep,
and is pointed in front. The sleeves are flowing.
A trimming of very deep black lace (from
ten to twelve inches) ornaments the skirt and
the bottom of the yoke. The whole is finished
by a neat ornament made of a succession of
small loops of No. 6 satin ribbon terminating in

<p class="center">(<em>See Plate in front of Book.</em>)</p>

<p>Consists of three three-quarter circular capes
upon a circular skirt. The first is plain, the
others full, and are of equal depth. The skirt,
however, is about one-third less in depth below
the capes than they are with each other. It
may be constructed of cloth, but the one illustrated
is of royal purple velvet, edged around
each cape with royal ermine six inches wide.
The bottom of the skirt, however, is wider, the
fur there being eight inches. It is lined with
white enamelled satin.</p>

<p>This dress, which is a combination of the
"Polka Jacket" and ordinary dress, is exceedingly
pretty and elegant, and well calculated to
show off the figure to advantage. It is made up
in silk or French merino, and the trimming
consists of broad ribbon velvet, about an inch
in width, of the same color as the dress, or one
in good contrast. To those who are averse to
wearing the jacket as a single garment, this may
form a pleasing substitute.</p>

<p>Fig. 1, it will be seen, approaches more to
the style of the pelisse than the mantilla, a
fashion that bids fair to be quite general the
entire winter for outside garments, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pardessus</i>,
as the French call them. This, however, is intended
for the milder season of spring, being
made of rich violet-colored taffeta, trimmed with
bows of thick satin ribbon, the same shade in
front, and encircled by two falls of black lace.</p>

<p>Figs. 2 and 3 are breakfast caps, Fig. 2 being
intended for a bride or young married lady, being
composed of lace and close bows of rose-colored
satin ribbon; the cap fits close to the
head, a fall of broad ribbon coming behind the
ear.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 is more novel in shape, and intended
for an older person, the trimming encircling the
face.</p>

<p><em>Materials.</em>&mdash;French muslin, with royal embroidery cotton,
No. 30, and Moravian, No. 24.</p></blockquote>

<p>This engraving is on a scale just half the size
of the original pattern. It is so strong that it is
peculiarly adapted for jupons, which are worn,
generally, most elaborately trimmed. The edge,
which consists of a single scallop, is considerably
raised; the Moravian cotton is to be used
for this purpose. The wheels are all worked
round in button-hole stitch, over a tracing of
three threads, a rosette being in the centre of
each. Indeed, if the entire pattern be overcast,
instead of being sewed in the usual way, it will
contribute much to the durability as well as the
appearance of the work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Material.</em>&mdash;French embroidery cotton, No. 20.</p></blockquote>

<p>This description of work, now so extremely
fashionable for every description of dress, is
usually done on fine jacconet muslin; and, to
prepare the pattern, either of the following methods
may be used: Place the muslin over the
pattern, taking care to keep it even and tight;
then, with a fine camel-hair brush, and a solution
of indigo or powder blue, mixed with gum-water,
copy the outline of the pattern, and, to
continue it, take care, after one length of the
design is drawn, to place the muslin so that the
pattern joins correctly. The other method, which
is useful for thicker material&mdash;take the design,
and, with a fine penknife or scissors, cut out the
blue parts of the pattern, place it over the material
to be used, and trace it round the cut-out
parts as above directed; pierce the small eyelet-hole
with a stiletto. When the pattern is prepared,
tack the muslin on a piece of oil-cloth
(green is the best color to work on for all descriptions
of embroidery); run twice round the
outline of the pattern with the cotton used double,
and join the open spaces, cut a small piece
out of the centre of the rounds and ovals, and,
with the single cotton, work the edges in overcast
stitch&mdash;the cotton run round, and the edges
cut, forming the foundation. In the parts between
the ovals and rounds, when there is only
a small division of muslin, the whole should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
overcast so as to form one bar between the open
spaces. Repeat the same for the ovals which
form the scallop round the outer edge, the diamonds
of twelve ovals, and the rounds which
form the Vandykes. The remainder of the pattern
is worked in the same manner; but, instead
of the overcast stitch, the open spaces are to be
sewn thickly over. A small portion only of the
pattern should be cut out at a time; and, should
the design be worked on a fine material, use
cotton No. 24 or 30.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Materials.</em>&mdash;French muslin, with embroidery cottons,
Nos. 70 and 50; and boar's head sewing cotton, No. 90.</p></blockquote>

<p>As the popularity of embroidery in muslin has
become greater during the past year than it had
been for a long period previous to it, so the skill
of the majority of lady-workers has greatly increased;
and we can now venture on presenting
them with designs of a more elaborate nature
than we have hitherto done, in the hope that
our friends will be tempted, by the novel style
of the pattern, to try the effect of a blending of
the open work with satin-stitch.</p>

<p>The medallions are given of the full size, and
any number may be used for a collar, according
to the taste of the wearer. One half must fall
in one direction, and the other half in the opposite
one. Perhaps the design may appear hardly
deep enough to those who are accustomed to the
outrageous size of some of the mousquetaire collars;
but very large collars are entirely exploded,
and the dimensions of this now given are quite
in accordance with the mode.</p>

<p>The design is so clearly seen in the engraving
that no description of it is required. The finest
embroidery cotton is to be used for the satin-stitch,
and for sewing round the eyelet-holes;
the coarser for the button-hole stitch; the boar's
head cotton for the herring-bone.</p>

<p>Our American Peripatetics&mdash;that is, travelling lecturers&mdash;are
now, and have been since last October, in full voice
among us. To number the amount of "good sentences
and well pronounced" uttered by these popular instructors
during the season, would require the assistance of a calculating
machine. Let us hope the effect of all this speechifying
may be salutary. At any rate, none will deny that
the general tendency of this mode of evening entertainments
is innocent, and if the knowledge thus acquired is
not of great amount, the love of knowledge is warmed into
new life, and the desire to improve awakened; and then,
women are admitted to these lessons of literature and
philosophy, a vital improvement on the Aristotelian platform.
Let the educator be rightly instructed&mdash;woman is
the educator of the race&mdash;and who shall set bounds to the
progress of humanity? But the lectures&mdash;among those
we have heard or read, as reported for the press, none
pleased us better than one on Poetry, by Mr. Saxe; one
on "Books," by Mr. Giles; and the series on "The Poetry
of Poets," by Dr. Holmes. The lecture on "Books" was,
perhaps, the most original, and a few paragraphs we will
select as illustrative of the style and tone of thought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>The Power of Books.</em>&mdash;"Fragments of divine biography
swept away the bloody power of the Cæsars, and books
may set in action the most resistless natures&mdash;overturn and
obliterate empires. The elements, even, are weak to what
a book may be. The most accessible, the most manageable,
it may possess that which will change nations, and
make empires disappear.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"When we inquire what it is that causes the words of
men to live upon the earth after they have departed, we
may say, Truth; but that is undefinable: but if we could
arrive at the greatest cause, we would say, Humanity&mdash;those
attributes which constitute man's universal nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Of Books, good and bad.</em>&mdash;"A good book is among the best
of good things, and its contents are embalmed and treasured
up 'to life above life.' Good is not alone that which
is fact, but that which gives impulse&mdash;which does not flatter
into content, but quickens into inspiration; and while
a good book is the best of good things, a bad book is the
worst of bad things. But we must take a free literature
with its imperfections as well as its advantages, for an inquisition
of literature would be no more tolerable than an
inquisition of religion. Preaching, even, on bad books is
worse than vain&mdash;it only advertises them, and makes the
hearer eager to read and examine their contents, for how can
the preacher know that it is a bad book unless he reads it?
and why are his hearers not as capable to judge as well as
himself? The true guard against them is education, and
the next step is to treat them with silence and contempt.
There are those who desire a book as a living companion
of the mind; and to such, a good work is society to his
loneliness&mdash;a balm to his troubles&mdash;a friend to the friendless&mdash;wealth
to the poor, and moreover, can keep the mind in
action though the body dies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>The Pleasures of Books.</em>&mdash;"There is a joy in books which
those alone can know who read them with desire and with
enthusiasm; as from time to time there were books which
created order out of disorder, and made states, and shaped
empires. By books we can accompany the traveller, and
take a voyage with the navigator, see what they have
seen, and thus go back to other days, and other times;
can listen to eloquence which was not so much the
thought, of man as of nations, and read speeches of men
who incarnate whole civilized nations in their views&mdash;whose
impulse was the common heart. There is a
genius for reading as well as for writing, and there are
probably as few successful readers as writers&mdash;that is, those
who come in material relation to the meaning of the author;
for, without imbibing the spirit of the writer, there
can be no criticism."</p>

<p class="p6"><a name="LITERATURE_FOR_LADIES" id="LITERATURE_FOR_LADIES"></a>LITERATURE FOR LADIES.</p>

<p>Among the books of interest lately published, we must
place the last work<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> by Miss Bremer, which needs to be read
in the spirit of the writer&mdash;that is, in the love of the true
and the good, which she deeply manifests, in order to be
justly appreciated. We gave in our last number a short
notice of this remarkable work, intending to prepare a
longer critique for this month; and regret we have been
hindered from completing our intention. But as the work
cannot now be readily obtained, our readers who have not
read it, will, we are sure, be gratified by a few selections
expressive of Miss Bremer's opinions concerning the position,
prospects, and progress of American women.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>The Ideal of Man and Woman in America.</em>&mdash;"The ideal
of the men of America seems to me to be, purity of intention,
decision in will, energy in action, simplicity and gentleness
in demeanor. Hence it is that there is something
tender and chivalric in his behavior to women, which is
infinitely becoming to him. In every woman he respects
his own mother.</p>

<p>"In the same way it appeared to me that the ideal of the
women of America, of the women of the New World, is
independence in character, gentleness of demeanor and
manner. The American's ideal of happiness seems to me
to be, marriage and home, combined with public activity.</p>

<p>"Of the American home, I have seen enough and heard
enough for me to be able to say that the women have, in
general, all the rule there that they wish to have. Woman
is the centre and lawgiver in the homes of the New World,
and the American man loves that it should be so. I must,
however, say, that in the happy homes in which I lived,
I saw the wife equally careful to guide herself by the wishes
of her husband, as he was to indulge her; affection and
sound reason make all things equal."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Female Education in America.</em>&mdash;"The educational institutions
for women are, in general, much superior to
those of Europe, and perhaps the most important work
which America is doing for the future of humanity, consists
in her treatment and education of woman. Woman's
increasing value as a <em>teacher</em>, and the employment of her
as such in public schools, even in those for boys, is a public
fact in these States; which greatly delights me. Seminaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
have been established to educate her for this vocation.
It even seems as if the daughters of New England had a
peculiar faculty and love for this employment. Young
girls of fortune devote themselves to it. The daughters
of poor farmers go to work in the manufactories a sufficient
time to earn the necessary sum to put themselves to
school, and thus to become teachers in due course. Whole
crowds of school teachers go from New England to the
Western and Southern States, where schools are established
and placed under their direction. In the schools for
young ladies, they learn the classics, mathematics, physics,
algebra, with great case, and pass their examination like
young men. Not long since, a young lady in Nantucket,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
not far from Boston, distinguished herself in astronomy;
discovered a new planet, and received in consequence a
medal from the King of Denmark."&mdash;Vol. i. pp. 190, 191.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><a name="WOMAN_THE_PHYSICIAN" id="WOMAN_THE_PHYSICIAN"></a><em>Woman the Physician for her own Sex.</em>&mdash;"When one reflects
how important for future generations is the proper
estimation of the woman and the child, how much depends
upon diet, upon that fostering which lies beyond the sphere
of the physician and his oversight, and which woman alone
can rightly understand, who can doubt the importance of
the female physician, in whose case science steps in to
aid natural sense, and to constitute her the best helper and
counsellor of women and children? That women have a
natural feeling and talent for the vocation of physician, is
proved by innumerable instances from the experience of
all ages and people, and it is a shame and a pity that men
have not, hitherto, permitted these to be developed by
science.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"In the old times, the physician was also the priest, and
consecrated to holy mysteries. The descendants of Æsculapius
were considered a holy race, and among them were
also women; the daughter of Æsculapius Hygeia, one of
them, was called the Goddess of Health. Of this race came
Hippocrates. We now talk about Hygeia, but we only
talk. She must be recalled to earth, she must have room
given her, and justice done her, if she is to present the
earth with a new Hippocrates."&mdash;Vol. i. pp. 143, 144.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Family Affections in America.</em>&mdash;"The family relationship
between parents and children seems to me particularly
beautiful, especially as regards the parents towards the
children. The beautiful maternal instinct is inborn in
the American woman, at least, in all its fervent, heart-felt
sentiment; and better and more affectionate family-fathers
than the men of America, I have seen no where in
the world. They have in particular a charming weakness
for&mdash;daughters, and God bless them for it! I hope the
daughters may know how to return it with interest."&mdash;Vol.
i. p. 337.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>The American Thanksgiving.</em>&mdash;"After breakfast, we went
to church, for this day (Thanksgiving) is as sacred throughout
the country.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"Why have not we, why have not all people such a festival
in the year? It has grown here out of the necessities
of the nobler popular heart; it is the ascribing of our
highest earthly blessings to their heavenly Giver. We, in
Sweden, have many publicly appointed days for prayer,
but none for Thanksgiving; it is not right and noble."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was Miss Bremer's appreciation of our Thanksgiving
Festival, and thus it will be approved and followed in all
Christendom, when the popular heart and voice shall bear
sway. A national Thanksgiving Day!&mdash;If this could once
be established in our own land, Americans would soon introduce
its observance and cheerful festivities into every
part of the world where they are found, and thus, our
American Thanksgiving would be the example for all people.</p>

<p><em>The last Thursday in November</em> has these advantages&mdash;harvests
of all kinds are then gathered in&mdash;summer travellers
have returned to their homes&mdash;the diseases that, during
summer and early autumn, often afflict some portions
of our country, have ceased, and all are prepared to
enjoy a day of Thanksgiving. The unanimity was nearly
perfect last November; still it would be better to have the
<em>day</em> so fixed by the expression of public sentiment that no
discord would be possible, but, from Maine to Mexico, from
Plymouth Rock to Sunset Sea, the hymn of thanksgiving
should be simultaneously raised, as the pledge of brotherhood
in the enjoyment of God's blessings during the year.
How this national festival can be made sure, we must
leave to those who have the guidance of public affairs; but
we do earnestly desire to see the <em>last Thursday in November</em>
become the fixed time for this American jubilee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A True Heroine.</span>&mdash;Margaret of Valois, sister of Francis I.
of France, was the most celebrated woman of the seventeenth
century, and deservedly esteemed for her piety as
well as great talents. Theodore de Bèze thus eulogizes
Margaret: "Her name is worthy of perpetual honor, on
account of her piety and the holy zeal she manifested for
the advancement and preservation of the Church of God, so
that to her we owe the life of many a good man."</p>

<p>To Margaret, also, is due the glory of elucidating the true
principles of royal government, which no man of that age
understood or taught. She says: "Kings and princes are
not the masters and lords of the multitude, but only ministers
whom God has established to serve and protect them."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">An Excellent Example.</span>&mdash;A school for street children
has recently been established in Brooklyn, N. Y., by an

contribution. In order to induce the children to attend
regularly, a good dinner is provided every day. The
number of scholars&mdash;all girls&mdash;at the present time, is
thirty.</p>

<p>This plan might be adopted in every city, and thus the

be greatly alleviated. Christian ladies of Philadelphia,

<p>SPECIMENS OF THE BRITISH POETS; <em>with Biographical
and Critical Notices, and an Essay on English Poetry</em>.
By Thomas Campbell, Esq. This is a new edition, revised
and with additional notes, of a work which has long since
passed the ordeal of criticism unscathed. Nothing more
remains to us, therefore, than to notice the beautiful appearance
of the present edition, with its appropriate illustrations,
elegant binding, and attractive typography. But
of this few need be told. Mr. Baird's poetical publications

<p>ON THE USE AND ABUSE OF ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS
IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. By William B. Carpenter,
M. D., F. R. S., Examiner in Physiology in the University
of London, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in University
College, etc. With a preface by D. F. Condie, M. D.,
Secretary of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, etc.
The author of this essay takes strong ground against the
habitual use of alcoholic liquors, even in moderate quantities.
Medically, he favors their employment in certain
cases; but with the same precautions that are observed in
administering "any other powerful remedy which is poisonous
in large doses." With a view to its circulation as
an auxiliary in the temperance cause, Dr. Condie, the
American editor, has added to the popular elements of the
work by explaining concisely, yet clearly, its technical language;
while Messrs. Blanchard &amp; Lea have prepared copies
in flexible cloth, suitable for mailing, which they will
forward, free of postage, to any part of the United States,
on receipt of fifty cents. For $30, one hundred copies may
be obtained, the purchaser to pay freight charges.</p>

<p>A HISTORY OF ROMAN CLASSICAL LITERATURE.
By R. W. Browne, M. A., Ph. D., Prebendary of St. Paul's,
and Professor of Classical Literature in King's College,
London. Unlike the generality of works of its class, this
volume is not made up wholly of the names of authors and
the titles of their works. These, however, it does not omit;
but there is nothing dry or uninteresting in their enumeration.
Well adapted for the use of classes in schools, it
need not be shunned by such readers as desire a graceful
style and entertaining narrative, while they would be fully
informed with regard to the subject upon which it treats.</p>

<p>A DICTIONARY OF DOMESTIC MEDICINE AND
HOUSEHOLD SURGERY. By Spencer Thomson, M. D.
First American from the last London edition. Revised,
with additions, by Henry H. Smith, M. D. A work of this
kind should be found in every family. It would prove an
invaluable assistant to a mother, or those who have the
care of the family. Diseases are described simply and
clearly; all the ordinary medicines are treated of, and
their use explained; and, although it by no means takes
the place of the physician, yet it would be of great use in
an innumerable number of cases, especially where the aid
and advice of a medical practitioner cannot be readily obtained.
The names of the compiler and editor are a sufficient
guarantee for the correctness of the work.</p>

<p>AN ATTEMPT TO EXHIBIT THE TRUE THEORY OF

the French, with a supplementary chapter, narrating the
most recent events, by John Oxenford. With a fac-simile
of a Chinese map of the course of the insurrection, and a
portrait of Tien-Te, its Chief. Probably no movement of
modern times presents so important an aspect as that of
the revolution now going on in the great empire of the
"Celestials." To those desiring information with regard to
its origin, leaders, and progress, the work under notice will

volume, this little work has been brought out to
meet the demand created by stirring events of the day.
Giving a clear and concise statement of the character and
antecedents of the two monarchs, upon whose doings the
attention of half the world has of late been riveted, it also
contains an account of the past and present condition of
the Turkish empire, in which the manners, customs, and

<p>MEMOIRS OF JOHN ABERNETHY, F. R. S. <em>With a
View of his Lectures, Writings, and Character.</em> By George
Macilwain, F. R. C. S., author of "Medicine and Surgery,"
"One Inductive Science," etc. This work the author confesses
to have been a labor of love. Both his heart and intellect
were with the great physician, whose life and character
he has so skilfully delineated that, while the medical
practitioner cannot fail to peruse his account with profit,
the general reader will find himself continually and deeply
interested in it. With regard to Abernethy's rudeness, of
which so many anecdotes have been related, Professor
Macilwain remarks: "His manner was at times, and in all
serious cases, and to hospital patients, as unaffectedly kind
as could be desired. On many occasions of minor import,
his impulsiveness of character led him to say things which,
however much we may palliate, we shall not attempt to
excuse." But "his roughness was really superficial. It
was the easiest thing in the world to develop the real kindness
of heart which lay beneath it."</p>

<p>LIFE OF BENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON, HISTORICAL
PAINTER, <em>from his Autobiography and Journals</em>. Edited
and compiled by Tom Taylor, of the Inner Temple, Esq.,
late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; and late Professor
of the English Language and Literature in University
College, London. "My task," says the editor of these
two thick volumes, "has been that of presenting the self-portraiture,
which Haydon left behind him, in such a light
as may show the work intelligibly.... It is not the biography
of Haydon, but his <em>autobiography</em>&mdash;not a life of him
by me, but his life by himself." And, truly, Mr. Taylor
has performed his part with discrimination and judgment.
Strangely interesting is the record that has thus been
given us of the great but unfortunate painter's struggles
through the world. Even as a study of character, it will
not lack readers.</p>

<p>HISTORY OF THE CAPTIVITY OF NAPOLEON AT
ST. HELENA. <em>From the Letters and Journals of the late
Lieutenant-General Sir Hudson Lowe, and Official Documents
not before made public.</em> By William Forsyth, M. A.,
author of "Hortensius," and "History of Trial by Jury;"
late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. In two volumes.
Nothing relative to the first Napoleon, however
trifling, can be valueless or unattractive. The work before
us is an important one, and of deep interest, inasmuch as
it is a very full, though not unprejudiced account of the
captivity and last days of the great Corsican. But, while
acknowledging the historical value of Mr. Forsyth's labors,
we reserve to ourselves the opinion that his special pleading
in behalf of Sir Hudson Lowe and the British government
will fall far short of its intended effect.</p>

of Minnesota offers one of the most attractive homes
for emigration. For the variety and picturesqueness of its
scenery, the salubrity of its climate, and the number and
completeness of its agricultural advantages, it is scarcely

to emigrate there, while the general reader will derive
from it much valuable information, with a great deal that

Favored by the completeness of the railway system of England,
Mr. Tuckerman was enabled to inspect many more

and cultivated powers of observation, refined in his tastes,
well-informed in all that relates to literature and art, and
mastering an elegant style, he has succeeded in investing
his pen pictures of well-known scenes with all the attractive
brightness of novelty, yet retaining the mellow softness of
tone so well suited to the character of the subjects.</p>

from original designs. This is a series of letters
professedly written from a country-seat, "up the
river," and somewhere in the vicinity of that most beautiful
portion of the Hudson, the Tappaan Sea. Suns setting
lovely and uprising gloriously, Shanghai chickens, cottages,
pig-styes, cows, horses, playful lambs, delightful landscapes,
and all the pains, pleasures, and occupations of rural life
during the year, are here talked of in the most natural
way in the world; but in good taste withal, and with
hearty, genial, delicate humor. Nor are literary topics left
untouched; while, occasionally, a sage reflection is thrown
in unobtrusively, yet so as to attract thoughtful attention.

<p>AUTUMN HOURS AND FIRESIDE READING. By

Mrs. Kirkland's two previous miscellanies may form
some idea of the perfection to which the engraver, the
printer, and the binder have carried their respective arts in
the preparation of this exquisite volume. Its contents are
worthy the grace and beauty in which they are enshrined.
Still better, like a pure heart in a fair body, they have
qualities that will long outlast their exterior elegance.
Wit, humor, philosophy, and sentiment, all of a tender,
womanly kind, pervade the various tales, sketches, and
essays of which the book is composed, and cannot fail to
render it what it was intended to be&mdash;something to amuse
the "cool, delicious hours that relieve the summer exhaustion,

<p>HUFELAND'S ART OF PROLONGING LIFE. Edited by
Erasmus Wilson, F. R. S. Our everyday observation is conclusive
of the fact that the art of shortening existence is
one with which but few are unacquainted; yet the majority
of men have the desire, if they do not act upon it, to
add to the number of the days of their earthly pilgrimage.
For such the philosophic Hufeland, at one time professor
of medicine in the University of Jena, has prepared the little
volume under notice. Stored with valuable facts and
hints, and sound advice, which, if attended to, must inevitably
contribute towards health and longevity, the work

<p>FRIENDS IN COUNCIL: <em>a Series of Readings and Discourses

To read it is like holding familiar converse with a man of a
large, generous, and kindly heart, and with an intellect at
once deep, comprehensive, and penetrating into the very
pith and marrow of the subject discussed. Vexed political
questions, and those connected with our social life and
happiness, are viewed with thoughtful consideration and
an evident desire to look on both sides with impartiality;
and, mingled with this, there is a genial undercurrent of
humor and fancy, which makes the book an attractive
one even to those who generally avoid the abstruser subjects.
The clear and simple, yet elegant style in which the
work is written shows that the author is a man of high
cultivation as well as of earnest thought.</p>

<p>From T. B. Peterson, 102 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia:
"First Love. A Story of Woman's Heart." By Eugene
Sue. This is said to be the author's best book. Powerful,
pathetic, and witty, by turns, and of exciting interest, it
undoubtedly is; but we can discover no other merit in a
hasty examination of its pages. Far more to be read and
admired, if not so intricate in plot or so lively in narration,
are the two companion volumes, from the same publishers,
respectively entitled, "The Iron Rule; or, Tyranny in the
Household," and "The Lady at Home; or, Happiness in
the Household." When we state that those interesting,
naturally written, lifelike fictions are from the pen of T. S.
Arthur, no one need be told of their excellence. Happy
will it be if the lessons, so pleasingly and so touchingly inculcated
by them, take root in the hearts of many and bear
their proper fruit&mdash;charity, peace, humanity, and love.</p>

<p>From Harper &amp; Brothers, New York, through Lindsay &amp;

the tender and childlike feelings which the world is pleased

<p>From A. Hart (late Carey &amp; Hart), Philadelphia: "Old

respects, a cheap American reprint of this volume
of travels through the United States. As containing anecdotes
and sketches of sixty or seventy of our notabilities,
it will create some stir and attract many readers. With
the usual amount of cant in regard to the "spitting" propensities
of our population, we find much amusing matter,
and no little philosophic consideration for manners and
customs undoubtedly strange and singular to a thorough-bred
Englishman. Mr. Bunn, while peregrinating the
States, must have encountered an unusual number of our
"fast men," who seem to have passed upon him for truth
many of the broadly-humorous, if not profane stories, the
relation of which is one of their peculiar amusements.</p>

<p>From Phillips, Sampson, &amp; Co., Boston, through T. B.
Peterson, Philadelphia: "Hearts and Faces; or, Home-Life
Unveiled." By Paul Creyton, author of "Father
Brighthopes," etc. This is a charming little collection of
domestic tales and sketches, making no pretensions to literary
merit, but really possessing it in a high degree.</p>

<p>From J. S. Redfield, Clinton Hall, New York, through
W. B. Zieber, Philadelphia: "The Yemassee; a Romance
of Carolina." By W. Gilmore Simms, Esq., author of "The
Partisan," "Guy Rivers," "Martin Faber," "Richard Hurdis,"
"Border Beagles," etc. This is a new and revised
edition of a standard romance, of whose acknowledged
merits it is not necessary for us to speak.</p>

<p>From H. Long &amp; Brothers, 43 Ann Street, New York:
"The Old Doctor; or, Stray Leaves from my Journal:
being Sketches of the most interesting Reminiscences of a
Retired Physician." A volume of well-told, thrilling, and
instructive tales, the character of which is sufficiently
shown by the title of the collection.</p>

<p>From D. Appleton &amp; Co., 200 Broadway, New York,
through C. G. Henderson &amp; Co., Philadelphia: "The Flush
Times of Alabama and Mississippi." A Series of Sketches.
By Joseph G. Baldwin. Many of these sketches, which are
mostly humorous, have already been admired and laughed
at, as they appeared from time to time in the "Southern
Literary Messenger."</p>

<p>From Lamport, Blakeman, &amp; Low, 8 Park Place, New
York, through H. C. Baird, Philadelphia: "The Ladies'
Glee-Book: a Collection of Choice and Beautiful Glees, for
three Female Voices; in English, French, and Italian.
Designed for the Use of Classes, School Exhibitions, and to
add to the Pleasures of the Home Circle." Translated,
adapted, arranged, and composed, with an accompaniment
for the piano-forte, by Henry C. Watson. Recommended
by Wallace, Strakosch, and Maretzek.</p>

<p>From Garrett &amp; Co., 18 Ann Street, New York, through
T. B. Peterson, 102 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia: "Romantic
Incidents in the Lives of the Queens of England."
By J. P. Smith, Esq., author of "Stanfield Hall," "Amy
Lawrence," etc. This is a deeply interesting volume of
semi-historical sketches.</p>

through Lippincott, Grambo, &amp; Co., Philadelphia: "Mrs.
Ben Darby; or, the Weal and Woe of Social Life." By A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Maria Collins. This is a graphic story of real life, from the
pen of a western authoress, who, if we may judge by her
present volume, is a lady of superior abilities.</p>

<p>From Hermann J. Meyer, 164 William Street, New
York: Parts 8 and 9, Vol. 2, of "Meyer's Universum."
Parts 6 and 7 (East and West) of "The United States Illustrated;

<p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! and are happy to
hear that you agree with us. We told you that our January
number would far exceed in beauty and worth any
other magazine, and your unanimous approval is grateful.
Well, what think you of the February? The Evening
Walk is a fine line engraving. But a word with you upon
that subject. It is a portrait of a lady of our city whose
least charm is her beauty. The graces of her mind and
the kindness of her heart far exceed the beauty of her face.
To know her is to love her.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> commence in this number "The Trials of a Needle-woman,"
by T. S. Arthur, one of Mr. Arthur's best stories.
It will take some five or six numbers to complete it.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> publish in this number a Valentine story, and the
supposed origin of St. Valentine's day. These two articles
are for our subscribers. In return, we should be pleased
to receive a Valentine from them, inclosing $3, $6, $10, or
$20. It can be addressed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We cannot help it.</span>&mdash;If our friends will send us such letters,
we must publish them. Mrs. J. D. M., of New Jersey,
writes: "Allow me to thank you for the pleasure your
'Lady's Book' has afforded me for the last <span class="smcap">TWELVE YEARS</span>.
As for the first sweet flowers of spring, so do we each month
watch for and welcome thy agreeable messenger."</p>

<p>Mrs. M. F. W., of Mauch Chunk, writes: "Permit an old
subscriber and admirer to congratulate you upon the great
success and unusual esteem with which your efforts have
been met. I am sure you deserve and get the thanks of
all the ladies for your untiring zeal in their behalf, and the
gentlemen also owe you many thanks for the patterns to
which they are indebted for many a pretty keepsake."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">How Sad!</span>&mdash;An editor writes us, and even in writing his
sad condition is shown; not that the writing is bad, that
is very good; but the words convey his desolation. "As
yet I am a single man." What a world of expression there
is in that "yet!" "Your 'Book' accompanies me occasionally
on a visit to my female friends." Take it along
with you, and, if that does not get you a wife, you may as
well give it up.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "Danbury Times" says: "While speaking of the
'Lady's Book' to a friend the other day, she remarked that
she had taken it from the first number issued in July,
1830, and that there was nothing like it." We know two
others who have taken it from January, 1831, within six
months from the commencement. It is needless to add
that such subscribers always pay regularly.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, we have received a letter from
a lady in Virginia, inclosing her twenty-second year's subscription.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> clip the following from the "Philadelphia Inquirer,"
of this city:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">American Stories.</span>&mdash;American stories are becoming
quite popular with the conductors of some of the foreign
periodicals. We observe that two, viz., 'My Brother Tom,'
and 'Marrying through Prudential Motives,' which appeared
in 'Godey's Lady's Book' some time since, were
soon after republished in England, without credit, and
have more recently been republished in some of the New
York papers as of foreign origin. Quite a compliment this
to Godey and his contributors."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>"My Grandmother's Bracelet," by Mrs. Hentz, a story
that we published in 1844, is now revived, and is going the
rounds of the press as a new story. No credit is given the
"Lady's Book"&mdash;<em>of course</em> <span class="smcap">NOT</span>.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Christ Healing the Sick.</span>&mdash;We have a few copies of this
splendid plate, printed on paper of a good size for framing,
still for sale at 50 cents each.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now print precisely 9800 copies more than we did
this time last year, and we are anxious to make it up even
10,000. If all our subscribers would follow the suggestion
made by the "Huntingdon Democrat," and many, we are
proud to say, have already done what that paper suggests,
we would soon have that other 200: "We are compelled to
consider Mr. Godey the most successful intellectual caterer
for the ladies in all magazine-dom, and all who agree with
us (and all who take the 'Book' must), should each one get
another subscriber to it, as a compliment to its enterprising
publisher for his untiring efforts to please."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Covers by Mail.</span>&mdash;We cannot send covers for binding by
mail, as the Postmaster-General has decided that they must
pay letter postage. Rather queer! when you can send
the whole Book, cover and all, and only pay book or
pamphlet postage. We can supply agents, and will send
any ordered in their packages.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> writes us to know how she can receive her "Lady's
Book" without being folded. She is the only subscriber
in the place. Our answer is: Get another subscriber,
and the "Book" will then be done up without
being folded.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span>, who sent us a club, writes as follows: "I extolled
your inestimable 'Book'&mdash;and why should I not?&mdash;showed
them the benefit to be derived from it, in order to
induce them to subscribe, knowing, if they could be persuaded
to do so for one year, that they could not be prevailed
upon in future to be without so interesting and useful
a book, especially a lady."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Editors turning Lecturers.</span>&mdash;Graham and Fitzgerald.
The former delivered a lecture before the Excelsior Temperance
Circle of Honor, some days since, which did honor to
his head and heart. The Circle have had the lecture printed,
and we have read it with great satisfaction. Fitzgerald's
lecture was upon music, and well he handled the
subject. The audience were much pleased, and so much
so that Mr. Fitzgerald has been solicited to repeat the lecture.
He would be a card for the lyceums in want of a
good lecturer.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">La Pierre House.</span>&mdash;We advise all our subscribers who
visit this city to stop at the La Pierre House. It is situated
on the widest street and highest part of the city. Messrs.
Taber &amp; Son are indefatigable in their efforts to please.
Their table is admirable, and their "grand hops" are the
most neatly managed affairs we have ever seen.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">R. H. See &amp; Co.'s</span> New Book-Store, No. 106 Chestnut
Street, is one of the neatest establishments in the city,
with the most gentlemanly attendants. All the new publications
will be found there; and great inducements are
held out to subscribe for "Godey's Lady's Book" and "Graham's
Magazine," in the shape of splendid premium plates
of a large size, and most beautifully engraved. This is a
great opportunity. Mr. See has also become one of the
publishers of that old and favorite monthly, "Graham's
Magazine."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>We hope this extravagance will not extend to this country:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">European Fashions.</span>&mdash;Letters from Paris state that the
extravagance in dress for the last winter will be outdone
by the magnificence of the toilettes in preparation for the
approaching season. Enormously expensive toilettes are
not confined to the older members of society; the juvenile
part of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beau-monde</i> is loaded with velvets, embroideries,
flounces, and feathers. As an instance of the vanity
and extravagance of private families in Paris, we may cite
an instance in which a baptismal dress of an infant has
been prepared, of exquisite embroidery and lace, at an expense
of eighteen thousand dollars. The establishment
where these tiny articles were produced has been thronged
with lady visitors, to see the rich and costly dress in which
the little creature is to renounce the pomps and vanities of
the world."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Jullien</span> the celebrated, and his band, have been here, and
we confess that we have never heard anything approaching
them. Concert Hall was crowded every evening they
played&mdash;and the repetition of the "Prima Donna Waltz,"
the "Katydid Polka," and the "American Quadrille,"
seemed more and more to please the delighted audience.
Jullien himself is an admirable leader. He is devoid of affectation,
although we were led to suppose he had a great
deal of it. His leading is most judicious, using his baton
no more than what seemed absolutely necessary, not
thumping constantly, as we have seen other leaders do,
seemingly with no other purpose than to call attention to
themselves. He is ably represented in his out-door business
by Dr. Joy and W. F. Brough, Esq.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dempster</span>, the delightful ballad-singer, has been with us
once again. He always pleases. And, wherever he may
go, we wish him great success, and commend him to the
kind consideration of our friends of the press. They will
find him a thorough, good-hearted gentleman.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Frankenstein's Panorama of Niagara.</span>&mdash;This great exhibition
of the most stupendous waterfall in the world, which
has excited wonder and admiration for so many months in
New York, is now at Concert hall, in this city. The brothers
Frankenstein say, with a perfect enthusiasm, that
the sight of it will remain like a vision of glory forever
upon your memories&mdash;for,</p>

<p class="center">"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."</p>

<p>This may by some be thought a high tone, but in these
days of panoramas, it is necessary to speak emphatically,
and they fear not the result, if you but see this work.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> extract from the Philadelphia "Evening Argus" a
notice of a very powerfully written book:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">The Old Doctor</span>' is the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nom de plume</i> of the author of
a book bearing the same title, and filled with fragmentary
sketches of various incidents that have actually occurred
in the practice of the unknown physician who records
them. The style is easy and pleasant, and the sketches&mdash;some
twenty in number&mdash;possess a thrilling interest that
will amply repay perusal. There are four superb illustrations,
and the book will prove a valuable addition to the
library or the centre-table. Since the publication of Dr.
Warren's 'Diary of a Physician,' nothing of the kind has
appeared that will vie, in point of interesting narrative,
with these reminiscences of a retired physician. Physicians
have opportunities for observation and for learning secret
histories that never can be allowed to any one else, and the
expositions of this book show how much stranger truth is
than fiction. H. Long &amp; Brother, 43 Ann St., are the publishers;
and this volume is well entitled to take a front
rank in the serial of family books which this house is engaged
in publishing."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">We</span> see that several of our bachelor brothers of the
'press gang' have taken up with Godey's offer to choose a
wife for each of them from among the 'Filadelfy Gals.'
We hope they are not all spoken for, and will put in our
order. Friend Godey, you will please look us up one with
rosy cheeks, not over five feet high, nor more than nineteen
years old; and of good 'mettle.' One who can set type,
and act as <em>sub.</em> in our office, when we are out, preferred.
Have her ready by the first of the coming year, and we
will call for her in person."</p>

<p>Friend "Argus," we would like you to call at once, for
we have here now some of the finest specimens of ladies
ever presented to an admiring public. But we do not
claim them as Philadelphians. There are three ladies <em>on
exhibition</em> here, the largest of which weighs 769 pounds,
and the least, some 600. The youngest is about nineteen.
Just the age you want, and if she can't set type now, she
could soon learn. She is ready now for you.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "Iowa Sentinel" says: "We have but one objection
to Godey, and that is the devoting entire of his magazine
to the ladies. However, it is just what it purports to be&mdash;a
Lady's Book."</p>

<p>Now, we do not consider this an objection, but a compliment.
We endeavor to please the ladies, and how gloriously
have they responded to the appeal we made to them some
few months since, and how from our heart we thank them!
Still, friend Sentinel, look over each number of the "Book"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and see if you cannot find enough to interest a gentleman.

better than it has been, if that were necessary.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Deserted Bride, and other Poems.</span>" <span class="smcap">By Geo. P.
Morris.</span>&mdash;A contemporary, in speaking of this work, says:</p>

<p>"Its splendid exterior, gay in gold and morocco, the finely
executed portrait, by which the reader may see that the
poet is no hard-featured wight, but has the impress of a
noble soul upon his features, and the beautiful steel engravings,
will attract the admirers of sumptuous books;
but they will find their taste purified and elevated, and
their hearts made better by the poems, which will cling to
the memory as they are read like strains of bewitching
music. Space does not permit us to point out our special
favorites; but they may be found almost <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">passim</i>. We
counsel all who have libraries or drawing-rooms to procure
the volume as an ornament to be proud of; while those
who have not, will find it a meet companion either in travel
or seclusion."</p>

<p>It is a most beautiful work, and is a suitable volume
either for a New Year or birthday present, and would be a
beautiful Valentine to send to a lady.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the "New York Spirit of the Times" we extract the
following. It is an excellent book, that we can vouch for.</p>

<p>"The New Household Receipt Book; containing Maxims,
Directions, and Specifics for Promoting Health, Comfort,
and Improvement in the Homes of the People. Compiled
from the best Authorities, with many Receipts never before
collected." By Sarah Josepha Hale. This is a very useful
book, and every housekeeper should have a copy. Young
women just married, or about to be married, would do well
to look into it, as much time may be saved and trouble
avoided by attending to its instructions. Mrs. Hale must
be exceedingly industrious, and if those masculine feminines
who go prating about "Women's Rights" would employ
themselves as usefully and virtuously, they would, like
her, have the thanks of the women of the world, and be
respected by the men of the world. Published by Long &amp;

<p><span class="smcap">T. S. Arthur's Home Magazine.</span>&mdash;This invaluable monthly
comes to us, as usual, richly freighted with literary gems
and treasures. In our estimation, it stands in the first
rank of our periodical literature. It is conducted with
ability and taste, and presents a well-selected variety of
choice reading, in which are mingled the grave and the gay,
the solid and the less weighty, with a felicity seldom obtained
in works of this character. It requires a rare discrimination
and a still more rare combination of the moral
and literary element to make a magazine what it <em>ought to
be</em>&mdash;what the high interests of society and the family demand
it should be&mdash;what a Christian parent would feel
a pleasure in putting into the hands of his children. But
such, we are happy to say, in our opinion, is the "Home
Magazine." The Little Colporteur story of Arthur in this
number, is worth, for its touching Christian simplicity and
its power to awaken and enliven the better feelings of the
heart, the price of the work for a year many times told.
May he write many such Christian parables! It is safe
copying the <span class="smcap">Great Master</span> here. We warmly commend

possessing even a spark of goodness, can attentively read
without being benefited by it. The public should in all
cases show a preference for such papers. Parents, especially,
in addition to the best daily paper they can procure,
should supply their families with two or three of the best
weeklies; and we would most cordially recommend "Arthur's

<p>Draw a design upon cardboard, similar to the annexed
engraving. Then cut it out neatly with a pair of scissors,
and gum a piece of black cloth or
velvet over the part intended as the
cap; attach two pieces of China
ribbon to the side of the cap, and
gild or paint the epaulettes. Sew a
small band of tape or webbing to the
back part of the kilt, large enough
to allow the two forefingers to pass
through it; and when this is done,
gum a portion of tartan over the
lower part of the design, so as to represent
the kilt, and otherwise ornament
the figure so that it may represent
a Highland piper.</p>

<p>If the whole figure is only intended
to be painted, the band at the back
of the kilt must be glued on instead
of sewing it. Thus far the figure is
complete, and you must now make the boots, which may
be easily done from a piece of plaid ribbon or stuff, and
some black cloth, leather, or velvet. Take care that they
are large enough to admit the tips of your fingers at the
tops, which should be ornamented with some strips of
China ribbon of various colors. The figure is now finished.</p>

<p>To make the piper dance, introduce the two forefingers
of the right hand through the bands, at the back of the
kilt, so that the knuckles only are seen; then place the
boots upon the tips of the fingers, and as the back of the
hand and other fingers are concealed, the Scotchman may
be made to dance by moving the fingers in such a manner
that the knuckles are bent during the performance.</p>

<p>"Mary Vale."&mdash;It may be interesting to this lady to know
that her story of "Marrying through Prudential Motives"
has been copied from the "Lady's Book" for March, 1853, in
two of the English magazines, recopied into the New York
"Albion," that professes to give nothing but the cream of
the English magazines, credited to an English magazine;
and now, being an <em>English</em> story, will no doubt be published
by half the papers in the United States. So much for the
British stamp.</p>

<p>"Nannie" is informed that MSS. for publishing must
only be written on one side of the paper, as plainly as possible,
done up neatly in an envelope, sealed, and postage
paid. MSS. always come to hand. We have never lost
one through the mails. To her other question, we have
repeatedly asked of our book publishers to name their
price, but they will not study their own interests enough
to do it. We could sell thrice as many books for them if
they would attend to it. In London, the price of the work
is invariably mentioned in the advertisement.</p>

<p class="center">"<em>The wicked borroweth and payeth not again.</em>"</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The "Wadesboro' Argus" says: "We have been lending
the 'Book' for the last year or two; but Godey positively
forbids it, and we will have to refuse it to borrowers. We
are now making up a club for the work for next year, and
ask those whom we have been supplying the present year
to send us their names with two dollars, and we will see
that they have the 'Book' supplied in their own names for
the next twelve months."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Letter from a Lady.</span>&mdash;"I am trying to raise a large club
here. Our only trouble is from borrowers. During my
absence in the country this past summer, the whole of last
year's numbers were taken out of the house, and two or
three of them were never returned. I have come to the
determination, as New Year is a time to make good resolutions,

<h4><a name="CHEMISTRY_FOR_YOUTH" id="CHEMISTRY_FOR_YOUTH"></a>Chemistry for Youth.</h4>

<p class="p8">HEAT, LIGHT, AND FLAME.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">Loco-foco Matches, etc.</span>&mdash;The oxygenated or <em>chlorate
matches</em> are first dipped in melted sulphur, and then tipped
with a paste made of chlorate of potass, sulphur, and sugar,
mixed with gum-water, and colored with vermilion;
frankincense and camphor are sometimes mixed with the
composition, and the wood of the match is pencil cedar, so
that a fragrant odor is diffused from the matches in burning.
To obtain light, a match is very lightly dipped in a
bottle containing a little asbestos soaked in oil of vitriol.</p>

<p><em>Lucifers</em> consist of chips of wood tipped with a paste of
chlorate of potass mixed with sulphuret of antimony,
starch, and gum-water; when a match is pinched between
the folds of glass-paper and suddenly drawn out, a light is
instantly obtained.</p>

<p><em>Prometheans</em> consist of small rows of waxed paper, in one
end of which is a minute quantity of vitriol, in a glass bulb,
sealed up and surrounded with chlorate of potass; when
the end thus prepared is pressed so as to break the bulb,
the vitriol comes in contact with the composition, and produces
light instantly.</p>

<p><em>Loco-foco Matches</em> are made of a compound of phosphorus,
rice-flour, &amp;c., colored with any suitable article.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Phosphoric Fire-bottle.</span>&mdash;Take a common brimstone
match, introduce its point into a bottle containing oxide of
phosphorus so as to cause a minute quantity of it to adhere
to it; if the match be then rubbed on a common bottle
cork, it instantly takes fire; care should be taken not to
use the same match immediately, or while still hot, as it
would inevitably set fire to the oxide of phosphorus in the
bottle. The phosphoric fire-bottle may be prepared in the
following manner: Take a small phial of very thin glass,
heat it gradually in a ladleful of sand, and introduce into
it a few grains of phosphorus; let the phial be then left
undisturbed for a few minutes, and proceed in this manner
until the phial is full; or, put a little phosphorus into a
small phial; heat the phial in a ladleful of sand, and when
the phosphorus is melted, turn it round, so that the phosphorus
may adhere to the sides of the phial; and then cork
the phial closely.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">A Combustible Body set on Fire by Water.</span>&mdash;Fill a saucer
nearly full of water, and drop into it a small piece of potassium
the size of a pepper-corn (about two grains); the
potassium will instantly become red-hot and dart from one
side of the saucer to the other, and burn vividly on the
surface of the water.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Curious Experiment.</span>&mdash;Procure three basins, and put
water of the temperature of thirty-three degrees into one
basin, of fifty degrees into another, and of a hundred degrees
into the third; then plunge one hand into the water of thirty-three
degrees, and the other into that of a hundred degrees,
and when they have both remained a few seconds, withdraw
them, and plunge both hands into the water of fifty
degrees: the one which was before in warm water will now
feel cold, and the one that was in the cold water will feel
warm.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Vivid Production of Fire.</span>&mdash;Take three parts by weight
of flowers of sulphur, and eight parts of copper filings, mix
them intimately together, and put the mixture into a large
test-tube, or small glass matrass. If the tube be now
placed upon red-hot coals, the mass begins to swell, and a
small ignited spark becomes first visible at the bottom,
which rapidly increases in size, and lastly, the whole mass
glows and exhibits a brilliant combustion without the
access of air or oxygen gas.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Fiery Flash.</span>&mdash;Pour iron filings upon the flame of
a candle, from a sheet of paper, about eight or ten inches
above it; as they descend into the flame, they will enter
into a very vivid scintillating combustion.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Spirits of Wine.</span>&mdash;Put a small quantity of spirits of wine
into a glass, and put a halfpenny or shilling in with it;
then direct the rays of the sun, by means of a burning
glass, upon the coin, and in a short time it will become so
hot as to inflame the spirits.</p>

<h4><a name="RECEIPTS" id="RECEIPTS"></a>Receipts, &amp;c.</h4>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="p6">THE SICK ROOM AND NURSERY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Improved Mode of Administering Senna.</span>&mdash;Take of senna
three drachms; lesser cardamom-seeds, husked and bruised,
half a drachm; boiling water, as much as will yield a filtered
infusion of six ounces. Digest for an hour, and filter
when cold. This is a well-contrived purgative infusion,
the aromatic correcting the drastic efforts of the senna. It
is of advantage that it should be used freshly prepared, as it
is apt to spoil very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warm Water.</span>&mdash;Warm water is preferable to cold water,
as a drink to persons who are subject to dyspeptic and bilious
complaints, and it may be taken more freely than cold
water, and consequently answers better as a diluent for
carrying off bile, and removing obstructions in the urinary
secretion in cases of stone and gravel. When water of a
temperature equal to that of the human body is used for
drink, it proves considerably stimulant, and is particularly
suited to dyspeptic, bilious, gouty, and chlorotic subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barley-water.</span>&mdash;To make good barley-water, choose the
best pearl-barley, boil it for a few minutes, then throw
away the water and add fresh, in the proportion of a pint
to an ounce of barley. Boil quickly, and then let it simmer
for an hour; strain and sweeten; flavor with lemon, or according
to taste. It is a very mucilaginous drink, and
beneficial to invalids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Advantages of Cleanliness.</span>&mdash;Health and strength cannot
be long continued unless the skin, <em>all</em> the skin, is washed
frequently with a sponge or other means. Every morning
is best, after which the skin should be rubbed very well
with a rough cloth. This is the most certain way of preventing
cold, and a little substitute for exercise, as it brings
blood to the surface, and causes it to circulate well through
the fine capillary vessels. Labor produces this circulation
naturally. The insensible perspiration cannot escape well
if the skin is not clean, as the pores get choked up. It is
said that in health about half the aliment we take passes
out through the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antidote to Arsenic.</span>&mdash;Magnesia is an antidote to arsenic,
equally efficacious with peroxide of iron, and preferable to
it, inasmuch as it is completely innocuous in almost any
quantity, and can be procured in any form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy for Toothache.</span>&mdash;Take of alum, in powder, two
drachms; spirit of nitre, seven drachms. Mix, and apply
it to the teeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Assist the Hearing of Elderly Persons when Suffering
from Deafness.</span>&mdash;Deafness is usually accompanied with
confused sounds, and noises of various kinds in the inside
of the ear itself; in such cases, insert a piece of cotton
wool, on which a very little oil of cloves or cinnamon has
been dropped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheumatic Embrocation.</span>&mdash;Take of spirit of turpentine,
spirit of hartshorn, liquid opodeldoc, of each one ounce.</p>

<p class="p6">DOMESTIC RECEIPTS.</p>


<p class="p8">CUSTARDS, CREAMS, JELLIES, AND BLANC
MANGE.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Second article.</em>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Baked Custard.</span>&mdash;Mix a quart of new milk with
eight well-beaten eggs, strain the mixture through a fine
sieve, and sweeten it with from five to eight ounces of
sugar, according to the taste; add a small pinch of salt,
and pour the custard into a deep dish, with or without a
lining or rim of paste; grate nutmeg or lemon rind over
the top, and bake it in a <em>very</em> slow oven from twenty to
thirty minutes, or longer, should it not be firm in the centre.
A custard, if well made, and properly baked, will be
quite smooth when cut, without the honey-combed appearance
which a hot oven gives; and there will be no whey
in the dish. New milk, one quart; eggs, eight; sugar, five
to eight oz.; salt, one-quarter salt-spoonful; nutmeg or
lemon-grate; baked, slow oven, twenty to thirty minutes,
or more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate Custards.</span>&mdash;Dissolve gently by the side of the
fire an ounce and a half of the best chocolate in rather
more than a wineglassful of water, and then boil it until
it is perfectly smooth; mix with it a pint of milk well flavored
with lemon-peel or vanilla, and two ounces of fine
sugar, and when the whole boils, stir to it five well-beaten
eggs that have been strained. Put the custard into a jar
or jug, set it into a pan of boiling water, and stir it without
ceasing until it is thick. Do not put it into glasses or
a dish till nearly or quite cold. These, as well as all other
custards, are infinitely finer when made with the yolks
only of the eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice Custards without Cream.</span>&mdash;Take one teaspoonful
of rice flour, a pint of new milk, the yolks of three eggs,
sugar to your liking; mix the rice very smooth, and stir
it, with the eggs, into the boiling milk. An excellent dish
for children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A finer Baked Custard.</span>&mdash;Boil together gently, for five
minutes, a pint and a half of new milk, a few grains of
salt, the very thin rind of a lemon, and six ounces of loaf
sugar; stir these boiling, but very gradually, to the well-beaten
yolks of ten fresh eggs, and the whites of four;
strain the mixture, and add to it half a pint of good cream;
let it cool, and then flavor it with a few spoonfuls of brandy
or a little ratafia; finish and bake it by the directions given
for the common custard above; or pour it into small well-buttered
cups, and bake it very slowly from ten to twelve
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apple or Gooseberry Souffle.</span>&mdash;Scald and sweeten the
fruit, beat it through a sieve, and put it into a tart dish.
When cold, pour a rich custard over it, about two inches
deep; whip the whites of the eggs, of which the custard
was made, to a snow, and lay it in small rough pieces on
the custard; sift fine sugar over, and put it into a slack
oven for a short time. It will make an exceedingly pretty
dish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gooseberry-fool.</span>&mdash;Put the fruit into a stone jar, with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
good Lisbon sugar; set the jar on a stove, or in a saucepan
of water over the fire; if the former, a large spoonful of
water should be added to the fruit. When it is done
enough to pulp, press it through a cullender; have ready
a teacupful of new milk and the same quantity of raw
cream boiled together, and left to be cold; then sweeten
pretty well with fine sugar, and mix the pulp by degrees
with it. <em>Or</em>:&mdash;Mix equal proportion of gooseberry pulp
and custard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apple-fool</span> may be made the same as gooseberry, except
that when stewed the apples should be peeled and pulped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">French Flummery.</span>&mdash;Boil one ounce and a half of isinglass
in a pint and a half of cream for ten minutes, stirring
it well; sweeten it with loaf-sugar, flavor with two
tablespoonfuls of orange-flower water, strain it into a deep
dish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fruit Creams.</span>&mdash;Take half an ounce of isinglass, dissolved
in a little water, then put one pint of good cream, sweetened
to the taste; boil it; when nearly cold, lay some apricot
or raspberry jam on the bottom of a glass dish, and pour
it over. This is most excellent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burnt Cream.</span>&mdash;Set over the fire in a pan three ounces
of sifted sugar, stir it, and when it browns, add a quart of
cream, and two ounces of isinglass; boil and stir till the
latter is dissolved, when sweeten it, and strain into moulds.
Or, this cream may be made by boiling it without sugar,
adding the yolks of four eggs, sweetening and sifting over
it in a dish loaf-sugar, to be browned with a salamander.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Cream.</span>&mdash;Take a pint of cream, add the zest of a
lemon rubbed on sugar; whip it well; add sugar and
lemon-juice to palate. Have half an ounce of isinglass dissolved
and cool; when the cream is thick, which it will be
when the lemon-juice is added, pour in the isinglass, and
immediately mould it. A smaller quantity of isinglass
may suffice, but that depends on the thickness of the cream.
Other flavors may be used, as orange, almond, maraschino.
<em>Or</em>:&mdash;Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it the yolks
of two eggs well beaten, 4 oz. of fine sugar, and the thin
rind of a lemon; boil it up, then stir it till almost cold;
put the juice of a lemon in a dish or bowl, and pour the
cream upon it, stirring it till quite cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Cream.</span>&mdash;Put six ounces of raspberry jam to
a quart of cream, pulp it through a lawn sieve, add to it
the juice of a lemon and a little sugar, and whisk it till
thick. Serve it in a dish or glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry Cream.</span>&mdash;Put six ounces of strawberry jam
with a pint of cream through a sieve, add to it the juice
of a lemon, whisk it fast at the edge of a dish, lay the
froth on a sieve, add a little more juice of lemon, and when
no more froth will rise, put the cream into a dish, or into
glasses, and place the froth upon it, well drained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Celebrated Honey Almond Paste.</span>&mdash;Take honey, one
pound; white bitter paste, one pound; expressed oil of
bitter almonds, two pounds; yolks of eggs, five. Heat the
honey, strain, then add the bitter paste, knead well together,
and, lastly, add the eggs and oil in alternate portions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Invaluable Ointment.</span>&mdash;Obtain a pint of real cream, let it
simmer over the fire, or on the side, till it resembles butter,
and forms a thick oily substance, which may be used as
ointment for fresh or old wounds, cracked lips or hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chapped Hands.</span>&mdash;Mix a quarter of a pound of unsalted
hog's-lard, which should be washed first in water and then
in rose-water, with the yolk of a new-laid egg and a large
spoonful of honey. Add to this as much fine oatmeal or
almond paste as will make the whole into a paste, and apply
this after washing the hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To make Wash-balls.</span>&mdash;Take two pounds of new white
soap, and shave thin into a teacupful of rose-water, pouring
in as much boiling water as will soften it. Put into a
pipkin a pint of sweet oil, fourpennyworth of oil of almonds,
half a pound of spermaceti, and set all over the fire till
dissolved; then add the soap, and half a pound of camphor
that has been first reduced to powder by rubbing it in a
mortar with a few drops of spirit of wine or lavender-water.
Boil ten minutes; then pour it into a basin, and stir till it
is quite thick enough to roll up into hard balls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Clean White Veils.</span>&mdash;Put the veil in a solution of
white soap, and let it simmer a quarter of an hour; squeeze
it in some warm water and soap till quite clean. Rinse it
from soap, and then in clean cold water, in which is a drop
of liquid blue; then pour boiling water on a teaspoonful of
starch, run the veil through this, and clear it well by clapping
it. Afterwards pin it out, keeping the edges straight
and even.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown says Mrs. Green&mdash;Miss White that was&mdash;doesn't
live happily with her husband. The poison works
and comes to Mrs. Green's ears. But stop, dear madam,
before you have exhausted your week's supply of fresh
pocket-handkerchiefs by tears&mdash;didn't you refuse Mr.
Brown's brother? There's the antidote.</p>

<p>Mrs. Knight tells all her acquaintances that Mrs. Day is
abominably extravagant, and caused her husband's failure.
Mrs. Starr is sorry to hear it, but recollects in time that
Mrs. Day once declined making Mrs. Knight's acquaintance,
because there were already more names on her visiting
list than she could do justice to. Mrs. Knight feels injured,
and sets it down to her living in a two story house
in a cross street. Hence her remarks.</p>

<p>And if our lady readers, young and old, would but notice
it, a similar antidote might be found for almost all the
troublesome reports that come to their ears. It is not in
<em>human</em> nature to give a kiss for a blow; and fancied or
real injuries are often visited upon one's character or
standing. The next best thing to being "let alone," is not
to mind what is said, so one is conscious of the right, and
never willingly to listen to what people say of you. If
disagreeable, you will be sorry you heard it; if the reverse,
the best of us are sensibly inclined to vanity.</p>

<p>THE season for transplanting roses "is from the end of
October to the middle of March. The autumn is generally
preferred; although, I think, it matters but little, provided
they are not removed during frosty weather. If standards
are chosen, each plant should be tied to a stake to preserve
it from the action of the wind; and, whether standards or
dwarfs, it is an excellent plan to cover the soil with old
hotbed manure, describing a circle round the plant about
eighteen inches in diameter. This done, pruning is the
next operation, and this should be performed in February
or March. As the roots of the plants will have been
curtailed by the act of removal, more pruning is necessary
the first year than at any subsequent period. It is scarcely
possible to acquire a correct knowledge of pruning otherwise
than by watching a proficient in the art. Nevertheless,
a few hints may prove serviceable. A young plant
should have from three to seven shoots; if more are present,
those best situated for the formation of a well-balanced
plant should be singled out, and the others cut
away. This is called thinning. It is now necessary to
shorten the shoots that are left. It is an axiom in rose-pruning&mdash;the
more rigorous the growth, the less should
the shoots be shortened. The kinds of weak growth may
be shortened to two, or at most three eyes (buds), the moderate
growers ranging from three to five eyes, and the
strong growers from five to seven. In the early growth of
spring, it is necessary to look through the plants occasionally,
to remove the caterpillars which infest them at that
season, and which travel from bud to bud, eating out the
core, and destroying the future flowers. The autumnal
blooming kinds require higher cultivation than the summer
ones. The latter flower in summer only; the former
give a succession of flowers during the autumn months.
By strict attention to these directions, a beautiful collection
of roses may be formed."</p>

<p>Collars and undersleeves being so expensive once more,
many ladies prefer to embroider for themselves, as the
style is by no means difficult. The pattern, principally of
eyelets, and with deep points of button-hole stitch (such as
we have given, from time to time, in the "Lady's Book"
Work-Table), is traced on the muslin or cambric. Instead
of the old-fashioned hoops, or tambour-frames, a piece of
dark morocco or kid is basted beneath, to keep the strip
quite straight and even, then worked over the finger. The
same is used for scalloping or pointing skirts, or, in fact,
for any style of cambric or muslin embroidery.</p>

<p>Slippers are principally in <em>applique</em>. That is, a pattern
of velvet, be it a scroll, leaves, or flowers, is applied to
black broadcloth by braiding or chain-stitching. It takes
much less time than canvas-work, and, though it will not
last so long, has a much richer effect. This style of work
is much used in smoking-caps, also in silk and velvet for
mantillas, short Talmas, etc. For canvas patterns, some
of the latest styles introduce the heads of animals, as the
fox, or the whole figure, a tiny kitten&mdash;on the toe, looking
out from a wreath of leaves or flowers, with a groundwork
of some plain color. Scrolls, octagons, diamonds, etc.,
shaded from black to the palest colors, are also much used.</p>

<p class="p6"><a name="JUVENILE_BOOKS" id="JUVENILE_BOOKS"></a>JUVENILE BOOKS.&mdash;FROM EVANS &amp; BRITTAN.</p>

<p>A celebrated publisher in our own country has come to
the conclusion that there are but three classes of readers
it is a bookseller's pleasure or interest to cater for&mdash;young
ladies, college students, and <em>children</em>. Medical works, law
books, or, indeed, those pertaining to any of the professions,
are to be considered as the tools of trade; but we
refer to those who read for pleasure simply, and enjoy
what they read without carping or cavil. Yet children are
critics, often admirable, though always genial, nevertheless
very observant of good morals and truthfulness to nature;
and, this most favorite class of readers constantly
increasing, it has become a distinct branch of business at
the present time&mdash;the selection and publication of juvenile
books.</p>

<p>Of the firms especially devoted to it, we have before noticed
Evans &amp; Brittan, of New York, now the publishers
of our old and well-beloved friend, "The Schoolfellow."
They are issuing many attractive volumes for the little
people, even though the holidays are over, and among
those destined to a permanent place in juvenile literature,
we notice "<em>At Home and Abroad; or, How to Behave</em>." By
Mrs. Manners. "Pleasure and Profit," an admirable series
of stories on the Lord's Prayer, was the first claim put
forth by this pleasant friend and instructress upon the
attention of the little people and their elders. The praise
which it won will be still farther secured to the authoress
by her second book, which is <em>exactly what was needed in</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<em>every nursery and school-room in the country</em>, and we predict
that it will become a text-book speedily. There is
running through every chapter the kindliest Christian
politeness, the truest of all, as well as many judicious hints
on the customs of good society; and yet, with all its valuable
instruction, it is neither dull nor prosy, but a series
of interesting stories, conversations, or rather "talks," in
the most good-natured and cheerful vein. We fancy this
will be the most popular of the series, in which the "Pet
Bird," by Cousin Alice, "Pleasure and Profit," and many
others are numbered. It is published in a uniform style
with these.</p>

<p>Then, again, for still younger people, is the capital
"<em>Laughter-Book</em>," and "<em>Naughty Boys and Girls</em>," with
their broad German mirth and brilliant pictures; the wonderful
"<em>Adventures of a Dog</em>," with text and illustration to
make any boy's holiday feast: "<em>Pretty Poll</em>," also illustrated;
and, above all, that perfect gem for the nursery,
"<em>The Book of Songs</em>," with its quaint nursery tales and
quiet hymns, illustrated by no less a pencil than Birket
Foster, of English celebrity. We particularly commend
the editorial taste and style in the letter-press and illustrations
of all these volumes.</p>

salesman at a shoe-store to fit on boots and slippers. If by
proper she means customary, we reply in the affirmative;
and, indeed, if the attendant is respectful, there can be
nothing more to say. If in the least rude, his employer
should at once be spoken to; a few such lessons would
teach civility. In Philadelphia, and sometimes in New
York, ladies are the attendants, which is much more agreeable,
and should be made a general custom. Whenever
the reverse is the case, the motto of the "garter" should

the wools strains the strongest eyes. Filling up the groundwork
is not so objectionable.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">La Tablier</span>"&mdash;Aprons are <em>not</em> worn in the street, but
are very fashionable for morning or home-dress. They are
two breadths wide, and reach a little below the knee, and
can be made of plain black or fancy silk, with outside
pockets or not, at pleasure. Velvet ribbon and galloon
are sometimes used in trimming them. Others are flounced
across the bottom by graduated ruffles, or ornamented by
knots of ribbon in the old style.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">E. Jane B.</span>" need not fear that we will betray her inquiries
to any of her acquaintances. We cannot recommend
any perfectly safe cosmetic but soap and water, disapproving
of the whole plan. Elder-flower water is said to be
efficacious, and is certainly simple. Powder of any kind
will <em>eventually</em> dry up the skin, and produce wrinkles and
discoloration, however much it may seem to improve the
complexion at first.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Southern Subscriber</span>" must remember that we have
no claims to medical skill as a journal. The word dyspepsia

Greek, and signifies, "I digest with difficulty." For the
oppression he speaks of after meals, we have always found
a cup of water taken clear, and as hot as it is possible to
drink it, the best remedy. Ginger, or any other stimulant,
has its mischievous reaction or consequent.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span>" can have the curtains cleaned at any dyers;

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rosa</span>" will find that we continue our gardening hints,

<p>"<span class="smcap">A School-Girl</span>" should never use common brown soap

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Housekeeper.</span>"&mdash;French mustard differs materially
from what is used in England, for vinegar, more or less,
enters into the composition, and the grain itself is not the
same; the finer sorts have always the addition of aromatic
herbs, so that there are no less than twenty-four different
sorts of French mustard. The common kind is made with
the grain of the Lenvoyè, which is of a darker color than
English mustard seed. It is ground up with vinegar on a
stone slab, and then put into pots for use. Provide yourself
with the senevè or senvy seed, and then reduce it to a
fine powder, mixing it with the French vinegar sold by the
grocers.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>See Plate.</em>)</p>

<p>We give the pattern of a beautiful dressing-gown in
needle-work embroidery. It may be done on plain cashmere
or merino for winter, or muslin or cambric as a summer

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p6">CHITCHAT UPON NEW YORK AND PHILADELPHIA
FASHIONS FOR FEBRUARY.</p>

<p>February, with its few mild days, is still to be reckoned
as one of the winter months by dress as well as the calendar.
The shop windows themselves present very few
novelties, and the side-walk none at all. The endless varieties
of cloaks and mantillas&mdash;the Hungarian, the Galeta,
the Nabob, the Victoria, the Norma&mdash;are still in season,
and the winter bonnets, with their profusion of trimming
inside and out, will be worn until April. We particularly
notice for the benefit of those having a large or expensive
stock on hand, the edict of a late foreign fashion journal:
<em>although large collars are the fashion</em>, it must not be <em>supposed</em>
that <em>small ones are altogether laid aside</em>. They are
still worn with cloth and merino dresses, and for the street,
as large ones do not set well over cloaks and mantillas.
Plain linen collars and undersleeves are still worn for the
street, and travelling, and for the morning.</p>

<p>For making dresses, there are every variety of sleeves.
For morning-dresses, the fulness at the wrist is gathered
into a wide cuff turned over. It is a mistake to copy the
full-puffed or slashed sleeve of Charles V.'s costume with
any other style of waist. Such fanciful costumes should
not be copied piecemeal; they lose all their effect. Better
be a little behind the fashion. Costumes invented for rich
materials expressly cut a very shabby figure in mousselines
or chintzes.</p>

<p>Basques are as much in fashion as ever, the favorite
style being renamed "Odette Bodies." The basque, or
lappets, being of the same piece as the body&mdash;not attached
to it, but gored out, as it were, over the hips. For slender
waists, the Parisian dress-makers have used gathered bodies,
with the lappets sewed on, as the Odette body, being
quite plain, is not considered becoming.</p>

<p>We conclude our chat by an article upon mourning, copied
from a valuable little publication, to which we would
call the attention of our lady readers. The title is significant&mdash;"<span class="smcap">How
to Make a Dress</span>: <em>a Help to those who wish to
Help themselves</em>." The American edition is altered and enlarged
by our own editress, from whom we quote the following
chapter:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p6">"MOURNING.</p>

<p>"Some guiding hints as to the choice of mourning goods,
and the general effect of close and half mourning, may not
be amiss.</p>

<p>"Close mourning, more commonly called <em>deep</em> mourning,
is usually worn only for the nearest relations&mdash;a husband,
parents, child, brother, or sister. A widow's mourning,
called 'weeds' in England, is not so distinct in this
country. There the close tarleton or muslin cap, with its
crimped border, is its accompaniment for a year at least.
The fashion has of late years been adopted in this country,
particularly in New York, where it is so common as not
longer to excite the curiosity it called out at first, when
worn by young persons. Bombazine, trimmed with folds
of crape (the dress, mantilla, and bonnet), with a veil of
double Italian or heavy English crape, is considered the
deepest mourning. Nothing white, as collar, cuffs, or undersleeves,
is worn by those who thus follow the dictates
of fashion, even in their sorrow, through the first six
months or year.</p>

<p>"Another style&mdash;also considered deep, and usually worn
for parents or children&mdash;allows of a variety of material,
as black cashmere, mousseline, Tamese cloth, alpaca, etc.
etc., trimmed with silk or ribbon, even plain braids and
galloons. Undersleeves and collars of Swiss muslin, tarleton,
or linen, relieve the sombre shade, and add a neatness
to the dress which it can never have where black crape is
used for the purpose. This is the most general style.</p>

<p>"A lighter mourning is black silk trimmed lightly with
crape, mode bonnet, etc. etc.</p>

<p>"Again, half mourning admits of as great a variety in
shade and material as colors; lead and stone colors being
considered appropriate; lavender, and even deep purple,
are often used. What is thus denominated 'dressy black,'
or, by the witty author of 'How to get Married,' 'mitigated
grief,' seems to us to lose the sacredness with which sorrow
usually invests the dress of a mourner.</p>

<p>"In choosing mourning goods, the first essential, <em>even
before quality</em>, is a good shade of black, neither blue nor
rusty; a dead, solid color is considered most desirable. If
possible, have the dress, mantle, and bonnet from the
same piece, either in bombazine or silk. It gives the whole
dress the same shade, and will wear alike. Never get a
cheap material in black; it will be sure to fade or grow
rusty. Here, especially, <em>the dearest is always the cheapest in
the end</em>. For constant wear, we prefer cashmeres, or even
plain mousselines, to bombazines. Black English chintzes
make nice morning-dresses, and fade very little in washing.
For summer wear, <em>barèges</em>, silk tissues, and grenadines
are considered deep mourning. The cross-barred
<em>barège</em> is the strongest, and grenadines of good quality will
wear several years.</p>

<p>"Although not exactly belonging to our present purpose,
we would mention that drawn hats of crape and
grenadine, or even black straws trimmed with crape, are
appropriate to the second style of dress we have mentioned,
when the heat of the weather is too great for bombazine
and silk.</p>

<p>"Veils are of double crape, single English, and crape
lisse. 'Love veils' are a thick tissue or grenadine, with a
deep silk border.</p>

<p>"In making up mourning, if in a thick material, a lead-colored
lining will be sufficiently dark; in a thin material,
it is usual to have the lining covered with thin Florence
silk. Black linen will, however, answer the purpose. It
should be boiled first in salt and water, and pressed out
while damp. Black cambric, etc., will color the skin, and
the stain be found very difficult to efface. The same is true
of plain black lawns as a dress material.</p>

<p>"Very little trimming suffices for mourning; indeed, the
very intention of the dress would be lost if much were
used. We know this is often the case; but it is sanctioned
neither by taste nor economy. We have even seen <em>ruffled
bombazines</em>. We object to them decidedly. Folds, by general
consent, seem to be the most appropriate style; in the
first place, from the thickness of the material generally in
use, and again, from the plainness of the effect which is
generally required. Broad flat galloons have also been the
style the present year; but that is only a transient shade
of fashion.</p>

<p>"As travelling has always its accompaniment of dust,
gray dresses are almost invariably worn even by those in
deep mourning. There is a material of silk and linen
which will be found very serviceable, and is sufficiently
dark trimmed with black braid. As there can be very little
variety in close mourning, <em>neatness is considered its principal
elegance</em>, and is the point to be aimed at."</p>

<p class="p8">Entitled, <span class="p10k">"LEGENDS OF THE LAST CENTURY,"</span></p>

<p>written expressly for "<cite>Scott's Weekly Paper</cite>," and now first offered to the public.</p>

<p>All who enjoyed the rare felicity of reading <span class="smcap">Mr. Lippard's</span> famous "<b>LEGENDS OF THE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION</b>," published in the "<cite>Saturday Courier</cite>" <em>for fifty-six consecutive weeks</em>, will, we feel satisfied, be
delighted with the prospect of a new series, embracing the leading events in American and French history
during the last hundred years. The scenes, incidents, and characters of this, his last work, have been collated
with the greatest care and most diligent research, from the records, reminiscences, and popular traditions of the
people of both continents, and form the most reliable <cite>HISTORICAL CYCLOPEDIA</cite> of the present age.
Mr. Lippard has, in these Legends, displayed all the original power, brilliancy, and classic beauty of style,
which rendered his previous works so popular at the firesides of all true lovers of <cite>A SOUND AMERICAN
LITERATURE</cite>; and we feel proud in having the opportunity to announce that the readers of "Scott's Weekly
Paper" shall be the first to peruse them, and admire their separate and numerous excellences.</p>

<p>As Mr. Lippard will contribute solely to "Scott's Weekly Paper," the American public will see the necessity
of sending their orders at the earliest possible moment, in order to secure these <cite>GREAT HISTORICAL PRODUCTIONS</cite>,
which will not be published in any other form.</p>

<p>In connection with the above-named Legends of the Olden Time, we have the satisfaction to announce that</p>


<p class="p10l">EMERSON BENNETT,</p>

<p>the eminent Novelist, author of "Viola," "The Forged Will," and other works of unmistakable genius, has been
engaged to write one or more <strong>POPULAR NOUVELLETTES</strong>, the publication of which will shortly be commenced.</p>

<p>These will be followed by</p>


<p class="p10m">HENRY C. WATSON'S</p>

<p>splendidly illustrated story, entitled</p>


<p class="p10n">THE TWO-EDGED KNIFE,</p>

<p>the incidents of which are taken from the early history of the hardy Pioneers of Kentucky.</p>

<p>To these, we expect to add contributions from the following <cite>DISTINGUISHED FEMALE WRITERS</cite>,
with whom negotiations are now pending:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p10p">Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz,  <span class="mleft1">Mrs. D. E. N. Southworth,</span>   <span class="mleft1">Mrs. M. A. Dennison, and Lille Lilberne:</span></p>

<p>So that it may be fairly presumed and confidently promised that <cite>SCOTT'S WEEKLY PAPER</cite>, in excellence,
variety, and originality of reading matter, will be acknowledged at once as</p>


<p class="p8">THE LARGEST AND BEST FAMILY NEWSPAPER OF THE WORLD.</p>

<p>The Paper will also contain the choicest selections from the best American and European publications of the
day, together with Editorials on Current Events, Domestic and Foreign News, Graphic Letters on the Old
World and the New, Interesting Outlines of Social and Political Life, and, indeed, every feature that can delight
the reader and store the mind with useful and practical knowledge of the times we live in.</p>

<p class="p10r">T. S. ARTHUR'S HOME MAGAZINE.</p>

<p class="p8">THE CHEAPEST MONTHLY PERIODICAL IN THE WORLD.</p>

<p class="p10e">ONLY $1 25 A YEAR IN CLUBS OF FOUR.</p>

<p class="p10e">Eighty large, double-column Octavo Pages of Choice Reading Matter in each
Number. Elegantly Illustrated with Steel and Wood Engravings.</p>

<p class="center">THE THIRD VOLUME OF THE HOME MAGAZINE BEGINS IN JANUARY, 1854.</p>


<p>In conducting this work, the editor (T. S. Arthur) pledges himself to keep its pages free from everything
that is ill-natured, profane, or vulgar; while, at the same time, he will seek to impart thereto the highest
possible degree of interest.</p>

<p>Of its quality we will let the press speak. From hundreds of editorial notices of a highly commendatory
character, the following are taken:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arthur's Home Magazine.</span>&mdash;The publishers of this valuable monthly have added a new feature to its
attractiveness. The second volume, beginning with the number for July, opens with a beautiful steel plate,
besides a great number of fine wood engravings. The Home Magazine only lacked this feature, of illustrations,
to make it not only one of the best, but one of the most beautiful and attractive of all our monthlies.
With this addition, it will certainly rank among the first, if not at the head of the list.&mdash;<cite>Journal,
Greenville, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>Arthur's editorial department is characterized by sense, energy, and progress.&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia Delta.</cite></p>

<p>Parents, if you wish to create and foster a love for reading in your children, obtain Arthur's Magazine.&mdash;<cite>Courier
of Reform, Concord, N. H.</cite></p>

<p>Arthur's Home Magazine is before us in its endless variety. It is the finest breakfast-table companion
we meet with. A person can peruse its pages with pleasure and profit for a moment, or for hours.&mdash;<cite>Herald,
Fond du Lac, Mich.</cite></p>

<p>This monthly, although one of the youngest, is certainly one of the most popular periodicals in the
country.&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia Inquirer.</cite></p>

<p>This periodical should be a "standard" in every family.&mdash;<cite>Intelligencer, Amsterdam, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>Arthur's Home Magazine is rapidly making its way into public favor, as it deserves, and will, before
very long, assume its place among the best and most widely circulated magazines in our country.&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia
News.</cite></p>

<p>We can confidently recommend this magazine.&mdash;<cite>Times, Maumee City, Ohio.</cite></p>

<p>The contents are of the most interesting and useful character, and it is exactly what it purports to be,
a "Home" Magazine.&mdash;<cite>Literary Journal, Washington, Ind.</cite></p>

<p>We predict for this magazine a popularity never exceeded in this country. It is the best and cheapest
published this side of the Atlantic.&mdash;<cite>Herald, Springfield, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>Mr. Arthur has succeeded in getting up, in our opinion, one of the best and cheapest magazines of the
day. We wish the talented editor and author success in his new enterprise.&mdash;<cite>Cincinnati Daily Atlas.</cite></p>

<p>The number before us is of rare interest, and we doubt not of its success.&mdash;<cite>Scientific American.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arthur's Home Magazine.</span>&mdash;This monthly is a constant and welcome visitor at our table, and should be
in every family in the land. T. S. Arthur has done, and is still doing, more to promote the dissemination
of chaste and unexceptionable literature among his countrymen than any other writer of his times.&mdash;<cite>Chronicle,
Gowanda, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arthur's Home Magazine.</span>&mdash;This is an admirable magazine, conducted with great ability, and is entirely
free from everything that can vitiate or in the least deprave the mind. It is just what it purports
to be, a <cite>Home</cite> Magazine, eminently adapted to the wants of the family.&mdash;<cite>Miscellany, Thomaston, Me.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arthur's Home Magazine.</span>&mdash;Eighty pages per month of choice reading for $1 25. That is, four can
club and get it for $5&mdash;a little less than ten cents per month. You may pay twenty-five cents for a red-covered
volume by Mrs. Somebody, and the Home Magazine will be worth a dozen of that same&mdash;Fact!&mdash;<cite>Advertiser,
Roxbury, Mass.</cite></p>

<p>If you want good reading for your family, try the Home Magazine for a year. The price is so low
that you need not deprive yourself of any favourite publication in order to make the experiment.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
